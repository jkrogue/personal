Prostatic radiotherapy beads.Findings discussed with Dr. Hopper (ED) by Dr. Hendry (Radiology) on 9/20/14 at 12:13PM.END OF IMPRESSION:",1432,"AP PELVIS: 05/22/07CLINICAL DATA: 75-year-old status post fall three days ago.COMPARISON: No comparison.FINDINGS:There is a comminuted fracture through the intertrochanteric regionof the left femoral neck. The lesser trochanter appears to beavulsed.END OF IMPRESSION:",1433,"CHEST: 7/30/00CLINICAL DATA: Hip injury.COMPARISON: NoneIMPRESSION:Slightly low lung volume examination. Widening of the rightperitracheal region is likely related to vascular structures.Tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta is noted likely relatedto atherosclerotic disease.The lungs are clear without evidence of pneumonia. No pleuraleffusions are evident. Note that the peripheral most leftcostophrenic angle is eliminated from the examination. Recommendrepeat PA & lateral chest when the patient is able if clinicallywarranted.END OF IMPRESSION:HIP: 7/30/00IMPRESSION:There is a comminuted fracture through the intertrochanteric leftfemur with associated avulsion and distraction of the lessertrochanter.The right hip is unremarkable. Minor osteoarthritis is seen in thehip joints bilaterally.END OF IMPRESSION:",1434,"AP SUPINE CHEST: 09/29/98.COMPARISON: None.IMPRESSION:1. Abnormal parenchymal density right upper lobe. A significantparenchymal abnormality (malignancy) cannot be excluded.2. Left ventricular enlargement.3. No evidence of congestive failure.END OF IMPRESSIONPELVIS AND LEFT HIP: 09/29/98.COMPARISON: None.IMPRESSION:1. Comminuted fracture involving the intertrochanteric region leftfemur.The above finding in the chest (right upper lobe) was called to Dr.Adrian Green 09/30/98.END OF IMPRESSION",1435,"CHEST AP SUPINE FILM: 08/06/97COMPARISON: No prior films.IMPRESSION:1. No infiltrates or congestive findings.2. Normal appearing cardiomediastinal silhouette.END OF IMPRESSIONPELVIS LEFT HIP: 08/06/97COMPARISON: No prior films.IMPRESSION:1. Postoperative prior right hip pinning. Evidence of bonysynostosis is noted probably in the form of heterotopicossification extending from the right lesser trochanter to theright inferior pubic ramus.2. Comminuted fracture of the intertrochanteric region leftfemur.3. Osteopenia.END OF IMPRESSION",1436,"CHEST SINGLE AP SUPINE FILM: 06/20/97Compared to prior films.IMPRESSION:1. No confluent infiltrates or congestive findings.2. Large hiatal hernia.END OF IMPRESSIONPELVIS AP FILM AND LEFT HIP: 06/20/97IMPRESSION:1. Comminuted fracture intertrochanteric region left femur.2. Fibroid calcifications.3. Osteopenia.4. Chondrocalcinosis symphysis pubis.END OF IMPRESSION",1437,"PELVIS AND LEFT HIP: 05/14/97.FINDINGS:There is a comminuted intertrochanteric left hip fracture. Noother abnormalities are noted involving the pelvis or hip.END OF IMPRESSION",1438,"PELVIS AND LEFT HIP: 10/15/95IMPRESSION:1. Comminuted fracture intertrochanteric region left femur.2. Osteopenia.3. Degenerative changes at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 disk spacelevels.4. Clips at the level of the lower abdomen related to priorsurgery.END OF IMPRESSION",1439,"PELVIS AP FILM: 12/29/94IMPRESSION:A comminuted fracture of the intertrochanteric region of the lefthip is noted. Calcification is present in the pelvis consistentwith fibroid. Osteopenia is present as well.END OF IMPRESSION",1440,"RIGHT ANKLE: 7/16/95.CLIN DATA: Fall.IMPRESSION:AP and lateral views of the right ankle demonstrate obliquefractures through the distal diaphysis of the tibia and fibulawith mild posterior varus displacement of the distal fragment.Marked osteopenia is noted. Vascular calcifications are seen.END OF IMPRESSIONPELVIS AND RIGHT HIP: 7/16/95.IMPRESSION:A transverse fracture through the right femoral head/neck isnoted with superior displacement. Bones are markedly osteopenic.No other fractures or dislocations noted.END OF IMPRESSION",
