argues against acute fracture. If focal tenderness persists in this

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS:

AP, oblique and lateral views of the right ankle were obtained.
There is an oblique fracture of the distal fibula which extends to
the level of the ankle mortise. The proximal extent of the oblique
fracture is at the inferior aspect of the syndesmosis. The oblique
view of the right ankle is suboptimal for evaluation of the ankle
mortise, however, this view shows incongruence of the ankle
mortise. There is soft tissue swelling superficial to the lateral
malleolus. A joint effusion is present.

The above information was discussed with Dr. Sarah McCarthy prior
to this dictation.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Inversion injury of right foot. Evaluate for
fracture.

FINDINGS:

Bone mineralization is within normal limits. Linear radiolucency
through the fifth metatarsal base may represent a fracture. An
anterior plantar spur off the anteroinferior aspect of the
calcaneus is noted. In the proper clinical setting, this can be
associated with plantar fasciitis or ankylosing spondylitis. A
well-corticated bony fragment is seen just superior to the proximal
tarsal navicular just anterior to the talus on the lateral views.
On one of these lateral views, there appears to be a lucency
through its base at its site of apparent attachment to the
navicular. A small anterior ankle effusion is noted. No other
significant soft tissue swelling is observed.


IMPRESSION:

1. Possible fracture through 5th metatarsal base. Recommend
dedicated foot x-rays.

3. Accessory ossicle versus fracture through an osteophyte
associated with the dorsal aspect of the tarsal navicular, best
seen on the lateral views.

HISTORY: Ankle injury.

FINDINGS:

There is an oblique fracture involving the right fibula extending
from the tibiotalar joint proximally for approximately 8
centimeters. The most proximal portion of the fracture results in
stripping of a 3 centimeter segment of cortex through which an
additional fracture line extends.

The medial clear space between the anterior aspect of the medial
portion of the talus and the anterior aspect of the medial
malleolus is slightly increased measuring approximately 5.5
millimeters. This would suggest deltoid ligament damage.
Extensive soft tissue swelling is seen about both malleoli.

IMPRESSION:

1. Distal fibular oblique fracture extending from the ankle joint
line proximally for 8 centimeters.

2. Possible deltoid ligamentous damage indicated by mildly
increased medial clear space. The medial clear space can be
artifactually widened due to technical factors including plantar
flexion. Clinical correlation.

The bones are diffusely osteopenic. Multiple metallic densities
are seen in the region of the tibiotalar joint, compatible with
bullet fragments. There is joint space loss, articular sclerosis,
and marginal osteophytosis of the tibiotalar joint. The talar dome
also appears flattened and somewhat concave. These changes are
likely remote and may represent degenerative or post operative
change.

An ovoid ossific density is noted posterior to the tibiotalar joint

COMPARISON: None

FINDINGS:

AP, lateral, and oblique views of the left foot and similar views of
the left ankle demonstrate mixed sclerosis and lucency at the head of
the first metatarsal bone, of uncertain clinical significance. This
may represent subchondral cystic change related to osteoarthritis,
versus CPPD arthropathy. Similar mixed sclerosis and lucency is noted
at the lateral joint margin in the tibia at the tibiotalar
articulation and similarly may represent subchondral degenerative
change vs. CPPD arthropathy. Note that the joint spaces are
maintained.

No acute fracture or dislocation is identified.

Vascular calcifications are noted.

IMPRESSION:

IMPRESSION:

1. AP, oblique, and lateral views of the left ankle are submitted.
There is soft tissue swelling at this significantly deformed left
ankle. Some soft tissue mottling is also identified. This may
represent edema, although a component of cellulitis cannot be
excluded on the basis of these films.

2. There is significant bony deformity of the distal tibia and
fibula, as well as of the midfoot, talus, and calcaneus. Overall,
this is most consistent with the appearance of previous significant
trauma.

3. There appears to be fusion of the distal tibia and fibula, as
well as absence of significant destruction of the talus. The
calcaneus is also ill-defined and abnormal in shape. In addition,
the midfoot bones appear flattened, giving the appearance on lateral
film of a pes planus deformity. Multiple osteophytes are consistent
with degenerative changes in this region.

4. Given the extent of abnormal morphology of the bones in this
region, it is difficult to exclude an acute fracture, although no
acute fracture line is presently identified. CT scan may be
indicated for further evaluation. In addition, comparison with
previous films, which likely exist at another institution, may be
quite useful.

FINDINGS:

A spiral proximolaterally displaced distal fibular diaphyseal
fracture is observed. The fibulotalar joint space is increased,
consistent with dislocation. The distal tibia is also displaced off
the talus. A small fracture fragment from the articulating surface
of the tibial plafond is noted medial to the distal talus. No other
acute fractures are identified. A probable old fracture fragment is
seen dorsal and distal to the talus. Mild soft tissue swelling is
observed adjacent to the acute fibular fracture.

IMPRESSION:

1. Displaced fracture of the distal fibular diaphysis with extension
into the interosseous ligament and continuation into the articulating
surface of the tibial plafond with possible comminuted fracture of
the articulating surface of the distal tibia is seen.

2. The mortise is distorted, with both the tibia and fibula being
displaced from their articulations with the talus. This implies
stretching or tear of the deltoid ligament.

possible interarticular osseous fragments.

HISTORY: 32 year-old man status post trauma, concern for fracture.

COMPARISON: No priors at UCSF.

IMPRESSION:

1. A comminuted fracture of the distal right fibula extends into the
mortise, with subtle widening of both the medial and lateral clear
space and tibiofibular syndesmosis. Dedicated views of the tibia and
fibula are recommended to exclude proximal injury.

2. Mild posterior displacement of the distal fibula.

3. Small osseous bodies seen in the lateral clear space of the
mortise, possibly intra-articular.

4. Additional, well-corticated fragments proximal and distal to the
navicular bone may represent accessory ossicles or sequela of prior
avulsion injury.

5. Soft tissue density anterior to the calcaneus is consistent with
joint effusion accompanying the fracture.

Note: Findings were discussed with Dr. Peter Knott (emergency
department) at 7:30 p.m. on 12/11/2004.

CLINICAL DATA: 76 year-old female, rule out fracture status post
fall. Patient with Parkinson's disease.

FINDINGS:

Humerus: Two views of the humerus demonstrate no evidence for
fracture or subluxation. Humeral head is in good position within
the glenoid fossa in this limited two view study. No obvious
abnormality is noted at the elbow joint. There does appear to be
some increased density in the soft tissues of the mid upper arm
suggesting a possible superficial hematoma. The visualized
portions of the clavicle and acromioclavicular joint appear
unremarkable in this limited view as well.

Foot: Three views of the foot demonstrate osteopenia but no
destructive osseous lesions. There is joint space narrowing and
degenerative change noted at the first metarsophalangeal joint.
Subchondral cystic change is also noted at the distal metatarsals
2 and 3 in the right foot. The tarsal bones appear well aligned.
The base of the fifth metatarsal is intact. No significant soft
tissue swelling is noted.

Ankle: The lateral medial malleoli are intact. The talus is in
good position within the mortise. The base of the fifth metatarsal
is intact. No joint fluid or soft tissue swelling is identified.

IMPRESSION:

AP, lateral, and oblique views of both the right foot and right ankle
demonstrates small, nonspecific sclerotic foci in the proximal and
distal phalanx of the first digit, likely bone islands. On the
lateral view of the foot, calcific density is seen just superior to
the talonavicular joint. This may represent an avulsion fracture of
the navicular bone, and clinical correlation to site of pain is
recommended.

The joint spaces are maintained. The ankle mortise is intact.

1. Calcific density superior to the talonavicular joint, suggests an
avulsion fracture of the navicular bone. Correlation with site of

The ankle mortise is intact. There is bimalleolar soft tissue

Its well-corticated nature indicates that it is not due to acute
fracture, but may represent the sequela of a remote injury. There is
also a minor focal region of apparent cortical irregularity along the

results from an additional tiny superimposed os, but assessment for

exclude neoplasm. Fusions of the scaphoid bone with the trapezium and
trapezoid bones are seen with associated proliferative bone changes.
No acute fracture or dislocation is identified. No radiopaque foreign
body is seen.

RIGHT ANKLE AND TIBIA/FIBULA: The right ankle demonstrates
lateral soft tissue swelling, but no fracture or dislocation is seen.
The mortise is intact. However, in the right knee, a punctate
calcification is seen along the lateral tibial spine in the anterior
joint, possibly due to a loose body.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Ankle pain status post twisting injury.

FINDINGS:

An osseous fragment is noted distal to the medial malleolus
consistent with an avulsion fracture of indeterminate age. There is
extensive associated soft tissue swelling. There is widening of the
ankle mortise. These findings suggest a ""Maissoneuve"" fracture and
a tibia and fibula radiograph is recommended for further evaluation
of possible proximal fibular fracture.

Also noted is cortical irregularity of the superior surface of the
anterior talus. This may represent chronic degenerative change.

HISTORY: Right leg pain. Status post trauma. Evaluate.

FINDINGS:

Frontal, lateral, and oblique views of the right ankle demonstrates
a spiral fracture of the distal fibular metaphysis with minimal
displacement of the distal fracture fragment. Horizontal fracture of
the right medial malleolus of the distal tibia at the level of the
ankle mortise with minimal lateral deviation of the ankle mortise and
the foot relative to the distal tibia. Lateral view of the ankle
suggests a nondisplaced fracture of the posterior malleolus of the
distal right tibia.

Frontal, lateral, and oblique views of the right foot demonstrate a
nondisplaced fracture of the distal metaphysis of the first
metatarsal in near anatomic alignment. Bones are diffusely
osteopenic. Irregular bony fragment just lateral to the cuboid
appears well corticated and most likely represents an old fracture.

IMPRESSION:

Trimalleolar fracture including distal fibular diaphysis, medial
malleolus, and posterior malleolus. There is also a fracture of the
distal first metatarsal in near anatomic alignment. The lateral
aspect of the ankle mortise appears widened on a single frontal view,
and this is suspicious for ligamentous injury as well. The emergency

There is an oval, fairly well corticated bony fragment lying just
inferior to the tip of the medial malleolus. The adjacent margin of
the medial malleolus does appear somewhat irregular, such that this
may represent a chronic avulsion fragment. If the patient is tender
in this region, perhaps this represents an acute injury. However,
significant soft tissue swelling is noted on the lateral aspect of
the ankle, where no fracture is appreciated.

The foot demonstrates a moderate degree of metatarsus adductus,
although these do not appear to be erect radiographs. Additionally,
the hind foot relationship on the frontal radiograph demonstrates a
talocalcaneal angle of approximately 17.0 degrees, which would be
consistent with a hind foot varus if these were weight-bearing views.
A significant ankle effusion is noted on lateral radiographs,
suggesting underlying inflammation or prior trauma. If clinically
indicated, MR of the ankle would be helpful to assess soft tissue
structures.

IMPRESSION:

There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation. Irregular
periosteal reaction extends along the lateral margin of the distal
tibia, likely related to mechanical stress from interosseous
membrane. In this general region is subtle demineralization of the
lateral distal margin of the tibia. Additionally, the medial
malleolus itself demonstrates a similar pattern of demineralization.
No destructive cortical erosion is appreciated, however, to
definitively suggest infection. Due to the demineralization present
and, if clinically indicated, MR of the ankle may be helpful to
exclude infection if this is a clinical concern. Additionally, an
unusual osteophyte extends exophytically from the lateral margin of
the talus, likely related to osteoarthritis. An ankle MR may be
helpful in this regard as well, which could demonstrate underlying
ligamentous instability or injury.

Addendum # 1

Please note that the initial report described findings only on the
left ankle. Radiographs of the bilateral ankles are submitted. As
discussed on the initial study, there is a poorly corticated bony
fragment just inferior to the distal tip of the left fibula which may
represent an avulsion fracture. A significant degree of soft tissue
swelling is present surrounding the left ankle, but also to a similar
degree within the entire foot and within the more proximal calf such
that the swelling may be related to venous status or lymph edema.

On the right, there is a more well corticated subcentimeter bony
fragment inferior to the distal tip of the fibula which does not
appear to be acute in nature and likely represents a chronic avulsion
fragment. No significant degree of right foot or ankle swelling is
appreciated in comparison to the left.

IMPRESSION:

Large amount of soft tissue swelling is present surrounding the
ankle, particularly medially.

An oblique fracture extends through the distal fibula, several
centimeters above the level of the ankle mortise. The fracture plane
is fairly nondisplaced. An ankle effusion is noted on the lateral
radiograph, as are degenerative osteophytic spurs at the distal
margin of the navicular and along the inferior and posterior aspects
of the calcaneus.

A well-corticated round subcentimeter ossification lies just inferior
to the tip of the medial malleolus which likely represents an
accessory ossification center. A small avulsion fracture in this
location may also be possible.

1. Moderate soft tissue swelling surrounds the ankle.

2. Moderate irregularity of the distal aspect of the medial

indicative of prior trauma.

relate to degenerative change or prior trauma.

Three views of the left ankle were submitted for interpretation.
There is a comminuted fracture extending through the distal left
fibula with minimal anterior angulation. There is associated soft
tissue swelling. There is a well-corticated 2 mm density just
inferior to the medial malleolus which may represent an avulsion
injury or prior trauma. In addition, there is a well-corticated bone
fragment between the talus and the navicular which most likely also
represents old trauma.

disassociation versus a normal variance, since the scapholunate
articulation is also widened on the left hand. Degenerative

fractures within this region cannot be entirely excluded.

Developmental abnormality of the calcaneus, affecting the

in this region, but the findings on x-ray are more likely only
developmental. If there is clinical reason to pursue this,

swelling is present laterally. These findings likely represent
focal osteopenia; however, osteomyelitis cannot be completely

CLINICAL HISTORY: 58-year-old man with right foot injury seven
months ago. Now with swelling for five days.

IMPRESSION:

Minimally displaced transverse fractures of the right second,
third, and fourth metatarsal heads are noted. These are associated
with sclerosis suggesting that they are subacute or chronic. There
is also the suggestion of a possible nondisplaced transverse
fracture of the first metatarsal head with associated minimal
sclerosis also suggesting that it is chronic. Associated soft
tissue swelling subjacent to the metatarsal head is observed.
Although chronic osteomyelitis is not completely excluded, it is
considered less likely than simply unhealed old stress fracture. If
conservative management fails, a white blood cell scan or MRI could
better evaluate. Vascular calcifications are incidentally noted,
consistent with diabetes mellitus.

FINDINGS:

There is a comminuted fracture of the calcaneus which extends
obliquely and superiorly to involve the subtalar joint. There is
also the subtle suggestion of possible extension anteriorly to
involve the calcaneocuboid joint.

A second fracture is noted within the distal fibula, where the
lateral margin of the fibula demonstrates a cortical step-off with
extensive surrounding soft tissue swelling. A more moderate degree
of soft tissue swelling is noted medially.


IMPRESSION:

1. Comminuted, intra-articular calcaneal fracture, as described

projects just inferoposteriorly to the distal tibia and is only
seen on the lateral view. This could possibly represent a tiny
avulsion fracture suggesting ligamentous injury. If clinically

very subtle lucency which appears to be present within the lateral
margin of the calcaneus which may represent a non displaced fracture.

There is anterolisthesis of C4 on C5. In addition, degenerative
changes are noted in the cervical spine, most prominent at C4-C5
and C5-C6. The retrolisthesis of C5 may be secondary to
degenerative changes. Clinical correlation is recommended to
further evaluate the C4-C5 region. If clinically indicated,
additional views can be obtained to further evaluate this region.

No comparison.

IMPRESSION:

There is a fracture of the proximal fibula.

There is a well circumscribed lytic lesion at the distal tibia,
possibly representing a non-ossified fibroma. Additionally, in
the proximal anterior tibia, there is a similar lesion which is
less well defined involving both mixed sclerotic and lytic
components, somewhat eccentric and is along the inner cortical
border. This appearance is nonspecific, however, this may also
represent a non-ossified fibroma. Other diagnotic possibilities
include bone infarct. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Given this radiographic appearance, a more aggressive lesion is
much less likely. If of clinical concern, follow-up films can be
obtained.

Soft tissue swelling is noted about the lateral malleolus. Several

possibility of a nondisplaced fracture is raised. An ossific
density is present adjacent to the medial malleolus as well as a
small ossific density interposed between the distal medial aspect
of the fibula and the lateral aspect of the left talus. These
ossific densities are probably accessory ossicles that are not felt
to represent an acute fracture.

2. Rounded ossific density at the tip of the lateral malleolus.
This appears well corticated and it is unlikely to represent an
avulsion fracture. Clinical correlation is essential.

3. No convincing fracture.

COMPARISON: None

CLIN DATA: 46 year old obese female with left knee pain x 3
weeks; rule out fracture.

FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:

1. Slightly suboptimal lateral view secondary to patient
discomfort with positioning. No definite diffusion.

2. Small osteophyte formation with no significant joint space
narrowing consistent with mild early degenerative disease.

3. No fracture identified. If clinical suspicion is high,
recommend oblique views.
