TECHNIQUE:

Multiple contiguous axial images of the lumbar spine were
obtained at 1.25 mm intervals without the administration of
intravenous contrast. Additionally, coronal and sagittal
reformats were performed.

FINDINGS:

There is mild leftward scoliosis of the lower thoracic and lumbar
spine, apex at L2-L3. Lumbar alignment is normal. The lumbar
vertebra are normal in stature. There is bilateral spondylolysis
at L4, more prominent on the left, with marked surrounding
sclerosis. There is no significant displacement or evidence of
spondylolisthesis at this level. No evidence of spondylolysis at
the remainder of the lumbar levels. Spina bifida occulta
incidentally noted at L5.

Small broad-based disk bulges present at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.
 No evidence of bony spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal
narrowing. There is sclerosis of the left sacroiliac joint

COMPARISON: MRI 11/14/2007 and radiographs 11/2/2007.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Evaluate for spondylolysis at L5 and possibly
L4.

TECHNIQUE:

2.5 mm contiguous axial images were acquired through the lower
lumbar spine from L3-4 through L5-S1 without intravenous contrast
administration. These data were used to generate coronal and
sagittal reformatted images.

FINDINGS:

Bilateral spondylolysis is noted at both L4 and L5 without
associated anterolisthesis. Spondylolysis at L5 is somewhat more
anterior than the typical location for spondylolysis, raising the
possibility of sequela of prior trauma. The spondylolysis still
evident by linear lucency with sclerotic margins.

Lumbar vertebral morphology is otherwise unremarkable. Incidental
note is made of partial dysraphism at S1 level. Intervertebral
disc spaces appear preserved in height.

Sacroiliac joints appear sclerotic bilaterally, involving more the
iliac side than sacral side. This may be stress related, although
sacroiliitis could have a similar appearance as previously noted on
prior MRI dated 11/14/07.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 29-year-old male status post posterior spinal
fusion at L5-S1 for spondylolysis. Patient improved after the
surgery, however has developed severe localized low back pain.

TECHNIQUE:

The procedure, risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with
the patient and the patient's questions were answered. The patient
understood the risks and wished to proceed. Informed written
consent was obtained.

The patient was placed in the prone position on the fluoroscopy
table. Fluoroscopic guidance was used to mark the skin overlying
the L4-5 interspace at the level of prior laminectomy.

One percent local lidocaine was infiltrated in the subcutaneous
tissues. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 8.89 cm, 22 gauge spinal
needle was then advanced into the thecal sac at this level. After
confirming location, approximately 10 cc of Omnipaque-240 was
injected into the thecal sac.

The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate
complications.

Subsequently, 2.5 mm axial images were obtained through the lumbar
spine with sagittal and coronal reformations.

FINDINGS:

For the purposes of this study, the area of posterior spinal fusion
will be called L5-S1, in accordance with the surgical numbering.
Note that on the previous MRI read on 7/1/05, this interspace was
referred to as L4-5 with partial sacralization of L5. Again, four
non-rib-bearing lumbar vertebral bodies are identified with a
rudimentary pair of ribs at L1.

Posterior spinal fusion hardware is seen from L5 to S1, in
accordance with surgical numbering. There is persistent
anterolisthesis at this level with bilateral pars defects again
noted. On the coronal reformatted images, bony fusion of the
lateral masses is noted bilaterally.

A prominent bony spur is seen on the left adjacent to the L5-S1
spondylolysis defect, which is contacting the lateral recess.
There is no definite compression of the S1 nerve root in this
position. However, depending on the patient's position, this bony
spur may contact or compress the descending S1 nerve root in the
lateral recess or the exiting left L5 nerve root and correlation
with radiculopathy in these regions would be helpful.

spondylolisthesis, there is associated moderate narrowing of the L5-
S1 neural foramina bilaterally. Note is made of slight asymmetric
filling of the L5 nerve root sleeves, left better than right.
Additionally, there is associated increase in the anterior posterior
dimensions of the thecal sac at the L5-S1 level with slight narrowing
of the transverse dimension and mild spinal stenosis.

Intra-thecal contrast is seen outlining normal-appearing nerve roots
within the lumbar thecal sac. No clumping of nerve roots or abnormal
distribution to suggest arachnoiditis.

At L2-3, no significant disc bulge, protrusion, spinal stenosis or
neural foraminal narrowing.

At L3-4, slight asymmetric filling of the L3 nerve root sheaths,
right better than left, but no significant disc bulge, protrusion,
spinal stenosis, or neural foraminal narrowing.

ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. There is symmetric filling of the L4
nerve root sleeves bilaterally, and no significant spinal stenosis or
neural foraminal narrowing. Incidental note is made of a 1.1

TECHNIQUE:

CT was performed using 1.25 mm contiguous axial images without
intravenous contrast administration. Coronal and sagittal
reformatted images were generated. MRI was performed using a 1.5
Tesla magnet. The following sequences were performed following a
3D localizer: Axial, coronal, and sagittal T1 fast spin echo,
sagittal T2 fast spin echo with fat saturation, axial T2 fast spin
echo without fat saturation, and postgadolinium axial and sagittal
T1 fast spin echo with fat saturation.

PROCEDURE:

Informed consent was obtained from the patient including discussing
the risks and benefits of the procedure. These included the risks of
bleeding, infection, CSF leak, headache, contrast reaction and
permanent nerve damage. The patient understood these risks and
benefits and was willing rule out proceed.

Patient was placed in a prone position on the fluoroscopy table and
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine was
used for local anesthesia. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the thecal
sac was accessed at the L5-S1 level. 8 cc of Isovue 300 was injected
without incident. Multiple spot images were obtained. The patient
was subsequently transferred to the CT scanner for a CT myelogram
performed at 3 millimeter collimation from the T12 through S1 levels.
Coronal and sagittal reformations were also performed.

FINDINGS:

Bilateral pedicle screws are identified at the L4 and L5 levels with
posterior spinal rods seen. At the L5 level, the right pedicle screw
appears to coarse laterally with its tip located in a paraspinal
position. A bilateral laminectomy is noted at the L5 level.
Bilateral fusion masses are also present at the L4-5 and L5-S1
levels.

Bony alignment demonstrates spondylolisthesis at the L5-S1 level
measured at approximately 1.2 centimeters. This likely represents a
grade II or grade II-III spondylolisthesis. Widening of the spinal
canal is also seen at this level. Bilateral spondylolysis is also
present. There is marked loss of disc space height at this level
with sclerosis of the adjacent endplates compatible with degenerative
changes.

Diffuse osteopenia is present.

Limited view of the conus medullaris demonstrates a normal
morphology. Normal appearance of the nerve roots is also seen with
no evidence for arachnoid scarring.

Posterior to the L4-5 to the L5-S1 level, a lobulated contrast-filled
mass is identified consistent with a pseudomeningocele. This
measures approximately 3.5 centimeters in the craniocaudal dimension.

Axial images demonstrate the following:

T12-L1: A right paracentral osteophyte is identified which is
minimal in nature without resultant central canal stenosis or neural
foraminal narrowing.


L1-2: A minimal broad based disc bulge is identified without
evidence for resultant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal
narrowing.

L2-3: A minimal broad based disc bulge is identified without
resultant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. Note
is made of mild bilateral facet hypertrophy.

L3-4: A moderate broad based disc bulge is identified with a more
focal right paracentral component. There is resultant mild central
canal stenosis. Bilateral mild facet hypertrophy is seen.

L4-5: Widening of the AP diameter of the spinal canal is seen.
There is no evidence for a focal deformity of the thecal sac.
Inferior neural foraminal narrowing is present without apparent
impingement upon the exiting nerve roots. Bilateral fusion masses
are again present with bilateral pedicle screws again noted. No
central canal stenosis is seen. The above mentioned pseudomeningocele
is again noted.

L5-S1: Bilateral spondylolysis is again noted. There is no evidence
for central canal stenosis or focal deformity of the thecal sac. The
neural foramina appear patent. Note is again made of bilateral
pedicle screws. Again, the above mentioned pseudomeningocel is seen.


IMPRESSION:

1. Status post bilateral pedicle screws at the L4 and L5 levels with
posterior spinal rods. Bilateral fusion masses are identified.

2. Grade II to grade II-III spondylolisthesis at the L5-S1 level.
Bilateral spondylolysis is also seen.

3. No evidence for significant spinal canal stenosis. A broad based
disc bulge at the L3-4 level results in mild central canal stenosis.

4. Pseudomeningocele identified within the spinal canal at the L4/5
and L5/S1 level with approximate cranio-caudal dimension of 3.5 cm.
5. Severe degenerative changes of the L5-S1 level.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 28-year-old man status post lumbar drain
removal with positional headaches.

COMPARISON: None available.

PROCEDURE:

Available prior imaging and the indications for CT guided
epidural blood patch were reviewed. The risks, benefits and
alternatives were discussed with the patient, and all questions
were fully answered. The risk discussed included but are not
limited bleeding, infection, CSF leak, head ache, and
unsuccessful procedure. Written informed consent was obtained for
the medical record, and a formal ""time out"" procedure was
performed per UCSF protocol, verifying the correct patient,
procedure, and procedure site.

Positioned prone on the CT table, a suitable trajectory for
access to the epidural space was identified at the visualized
level of prior lumbar drain placement at L3-4. The overlying skin
was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion and then
anesthetized via local infiltration of approximately 8 cc 1%
lidocaine buffered with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate. Under serial CT
guidance, a 9cm, 22 gauge spinal needle was advanced into the
epidural space. Epidural needle position was verified by
injection of air.

10 cc of blood was withdrawn from a forearm IV and discarded. An
additional 10 cc of autologous blood was then withdrawn, admixed
with 1 cc Omnipaque 140 iodinated contrast, and injected.
Follow-up CT showed roughly 50% injection epidural and 50% within
the adjacent paraspinal soft tissues. The spinal needle was
advanced further into the epidural space and needle tip position
was confirmed with injection of 0.5 cc of dilute contrast. An
additional 10 cc of autologous blood was then mixed with 1 cc of
contrast and injected into the epidural space. Follow-up CT
confirmed the entirety of the second injection within the
epidural space at the level of L3-4.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no
apparent immediate complications.

TECHNIQUE: Helical axial acquisition encompassing the lumbar
spine between the levels of L3 and S1, reconstructed at 1.25 and
reformatted in sagittal and coronal planes.

FINDINGS:

There is normal lumbar alignment. There is right L5 pars
intra-articularis defect, compatible with spondylolysis. There
is no subluxation.

TECHNIQUE:

The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
patient. The patient provided written, informed consent. The
patient was placed prone on the CT scanner. A grid was placed over
the patient's lower back and select CT images were obtained of the
lower lumbar spine. Entry sites at the left L4 and left L5 levels
were marked using CT guidance. The patient's lower back was
prepped and draped in in the usual sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine
was used for local anesthesia. Under CT guidance, radio frequency
ablation needles, 20 gauge 15 cm with 1 cm active tip, were
inserted to the level of the medial branches of the left L4 and
left L5 nerves. Configuration of proper placement of the needles
using motor stimulation at 2 Hz was performed. No pain or
contractions were noted radiating to the lower extremities. Each
site was then ablated using 80 degrees Celsius for 90 seconds.
Following the ablation, approximately 1 cc of a mixture of
Celestone and 0.75% bupivacaine was injected into each of the two
sites. The needles were withdrawn. The patient tolerated the
procedure well with no immediate complications. The patient was
transferred to the recovery room where the patient was observed for

TECHNIQUE:

using 2.5-mm collimation without IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal
reformatted images were generated.

FINDINGS:

Lumbar vertebral alignment is within normal limits. No evidence of
vertebral body compressive deformity. The intervertebral disk
spaces appear uniform. The area of reported abnormal edema
involving the right L4 pedicle is favored to be edema related to
abnormalities involving both of the L4 pars interarticulares.
Specifically, there is sclerosis and mild irregularity seen
bilaterally within the pars suspicious for stress reaction and
possibly healed remote spondylolysis. At present, no discrete
fracture line is identified.

Although, limited in assessing the contents of the spinal canal, no
evidence of significant spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal
compromise. The patient is noted to have mild broad-based disk
bulges at L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1.

IMPRESSION:

line is demonstrated on the current study; however, these changes
could reflect spondylolysis which has healed or possibly ongoing
stress reaction which has not yet progressed to complete fractures.
The latter possibility is certainly a consideration given that
edema was seen within the right L4 pedicle on 04/30/2007. Further
correlation could be undertaken with bone scan with SPECT to see if
there is significant bone turnover in this region which again would
argue for more of an acute stress reaction, potentially warranting
activity modification and/or bracing.

LUMBAR CT MYELOGRAM: 01/09/2006

COMPARISON: Scoliosis radiographs 11/15/2005 and lumbar spine CT
11/14/2001.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 32-year-old woman with history of scoliosis,
status post thoracolumbar posterior spinal fusion performed in
approximately 1986. The patient reports experiencing low back pain
and left-sided sciatic which has been progressive worsening in
recent years.

TECHNIQUE:

A detailed discussion of the procedure was undertaken with the
patient specifically addressing risks, benefits and alternatives.
Following ample opportunity to answer any of the patient's
remaining questions, written informed consent was witnessed and
documented in the medical record.

The patient was placed in the prone position on the fluoroscopy
table and the region surrounding her lower back was prepped and
draped in the usual sterile fashion. Scout AP radiograph was
performed and fluoroscopy was utilized to localize the anticipated
skin entry site overlying the L4-5 interlaminar space.
Approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine was
infiltrated subcutaneously in this vicinity for local anesthesia.
Subsequently, a 22 g 8.9 cm spinal needle was progressively
advanced under fluoroscopic guidance through the L4-5 interlaminar
space into the spinal canal. The intrathecal placement of the
needle tip was confirmed by the spontaneous flow of cerebral spinal
fluid following removal of the stylet. Approximately 10 cc of
Omnipaque 240 was instilled intrathecally under fluoroscopic
visualization. The needle was then removed and a sterile dressing
was applied to the puncture site. The patient was then transferred
to CT where helical CT of the lumbar spine was performed extending
from T11 through the sacrum using 2.5 mm collimation. Coronal and
sagittal reformatted images were generated.

FINDINGS:

The patient has an S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis with rightward
convexity in the thoracic spine and leftward convexity in the upper
lumbar spine. As seen on prior imaging, she has undergone
posterior spinal fusion with orthopedic hardware spanning T8
through L4. The hardware is intact and unchanged relative to
11/14/2001. Moreover, effective osseous fusion is present at these
levels including near obliteration of the intervertebral disk
spaces as well as fusion of the facet joints and posterior
elements.

the conus medullaris terminates at the mid L1 level and is normal
in caliber. The lumbosacral nerve roots demonstrate no evidence of
abnormal thickening or clumping. The distal spinal cord and the
lumbosacral nerve roots are peripherally distributed toward the
right aspect of the spinal canal secondary to the patient's spinal
curvature.

Examination of the lumbar spine can be delineated by levels as
follows:

T11-12: No neural foraminal narrowing or spinal stenosis.

T12-L1: No neural foraminal narrowing or spinal stenosis.

L1-2: No neural foraminal narrowing or spinal stenosis.

L2-3: No neural foraminal narrowing or spinal stenosis.

L3-4: No neural foraminal narrowing or spinal stenosis.

L4-5: Secondary to the patient's spinal curvature, a disk bulge is
eccentrically prominent to the right extraforaminal region. No
significant neural foraminal narrowing is identified. Ligamentum
flavum hypertrophy and facet atrophy result in mild triangular
deformation of the contours of the spinal canal but no frank spinal
stenosis is present.

L5-S1: As previously seen. The patient has bilateral L5 pars
interarticularis defects with surrounding hypertrophic changes and
small ossific fragments which minimally indent the thecal sac. The
patient has approximately 25% anterior displacement of the L5
vertebral body relative to S1 compatible with Grade I-II
anterolisthesis. This results in diminished craniocaudad dimension
of the neural foramina bilaterally. In addition to vacuum
phenomenon within the L5-S1 disk, increased diskogenic sclerosis is
identified within the inferior end-plate of L5 relative to
11/14/2001. The spinal canal is elongated in a craniocaudad
dimension secondary to the spondylolysis. In addition to
uncovering of the L5-S1 disk, the patient has a broad-based disk
bulge which moderately narrows the right side neural foramen and
appears to be abut the exiting right L5 nerve root. Broad-based
disk bulge has become more prominent in the vicinity of the left
neural foramen resulting in severe narrowing. This appears
increased relative to 11/14/2001 in that clear fat planes are not
identified in the foraminal or extraforaminal regions between the
disk and the exiting left L5 nerve root.

DISPOSITION:

The patient tolerated the procedure well with no evidence of
immediate complication. She was transferred to radiology recovery
area following the CT scan and was observed for approximately 30
minutes. She was subsequently discharged to home in stable
condition.


IMPRESSION:

thoracolumbar scoliosis. Alignment is not significantly changed
from 11/14/2001. Orthopedic hardware remains intact. An effective
osseous fusion has developed.

2. Bilateral L5 spondylolysis is again noted with progression of

significantly changed with disk bulge abutting the exiting L5 nerve
root. More notably, the left neural foraminal narrowing is now
severe with complete obliteration of fat plane separating the
exiting left L5 nerve root from the adjacent disk. These
progressive abnormalities may account for the patient's worsening
left sciatic.

3. No significant change in mild degenerative changes in the L4-5
disk with associated facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum
hypertrophy. No neural foraminal narrowing or spinal stenosis
results.

TECHNIQUE:

The procedure was explained in detail to the patient including the
alternatives, risks and benefits. All the patient's questions and
concerns were addressed at that time. Written informed consent was
obtained. The patient is brought to the fluoroscopy suite. Spot
radiographs of the lumbar spine were then obtained.

The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and
placed in the prone position. Under direct fluoroscopic
observation, a 19-gauge 10-cm introducer was then placed into the
right paravertebral soft tissue at the L2-3 level and using coaxial
techniques, a 22-gauge 20-cm Chiba needle was advanced through the
introducer in the paravertebral soft tissues into the L2-3 disk
space. Similarly this was repeated for the L3-4 disk level. At
the L4-5 level, a left paravertebral approach was performed.

Attempts were made to access the L5-S1 level; however, the disk
space was inaccessible.

At each of the three lumbar levels, Omnipaque-180 contrast media
was injected under fluoroscopic observation with pain provocation
utilizing manometry. The volume of contrast at each level as well
as the pressure in pounds per square inch are noted. The patient
was then asked if he experienced any pain and whether the pain was
similar to his baseline pain as well as how intense the pain was.
After examination of each of the three levels, the spinal needles
were then removed from the patient and AP and lateral radiographs
were obtained. The patient was then transferred to the CT scanner

TECHNIQUE:

The procedure, benefits and risks as well as alternatives were
discussed with the patient in detail. All of the patient's questions
and concerns were addressed at this time. Written informed consent
was then obtained.

The patient was brought to the CT suite and placed in the prone
position. Under CT guidance, a site was marked over the puncture
site at approximately the L4-5 level. The patient was then prepped
and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine was
administered into the subcutaneous soft tissues. Under CT guidance,
a coaxial system employing a Chiba 19 gauge, 10 centimeter needle and
a Chiba 15 centimeter, 22 gauge needle was advanced into the
subcutaneous soft tissues adjacent to the right L4 nerve root at the
level of the neural foramen. The 22 gauge, 15 centimeter Chiba
needle tip was then advanced into the right L4 perineural and
epineural space and positioned confirmed by a small hand injection of
a solution of 0.4 cc of gadolinium contrast mixed in a 1:1 solution
of 0.75% Sensorcaine and Celestone. Once the needle position was
confirmed, multiple small injections of the 50/50 solution of

CLINICAL HISTORY: 34-year-old male with L4-5 spondylolysis with
grade I spondylolisthesis, status post prior fusion with
pseudoarthrosis, status post L5-S1 fusion with instrumentation.

The patient reports localized low back pain with radiation down both
legs.

TECHNIQUE:

The procedure, benefits and risks as well as alternatives were
discussed with the patient in detail. All the patient's questions
and concerns were addressed at this time. Written informed consent
was then obtained.

The patient was brought to the fluoroscopy suite and placed in the
prone position. The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual
sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine was administered into subcutaneous
soft tissues. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a site was marked over
the puncture site at the L5 level, where there have been previous
laminectomies.

Under direct fluoroscopic guidance, a 22 gauge spinal needle was then
advanced into the subcutaneous soft tissues into the thecal sac.
Upon the return of clear cerebral spinal fluid, approximately 10 cc
of Omnipaque-240 was manually injected into the thecal sac under
fluoroscopic observation.

The spinal needle was then removed using the stylet and then multiple
radiographs of the lumbar spine were obtained in AP, lateral and
multiple oblique views.

The patient was then brought to the CT scanner, where axial 2.5 mm
images were obtained from L2 to S2 in both neutral, flexion and
extension positions. Images were then reformatted in the sagittal
and coronal planes.

Patient was then brought to the radiology holding area where he was
observed for one hour's time. The patient tolerated the procedure
well without apparant immediate complication and was discharged in
stable condition. The patient was instructed to return if there were
any signs of fever, increasing back pain, persistent headache or
other unusual symptoms.

FINDINGS:

Injection of intrathecal contrast under fluoroscopic observation
demonstrated free flow of contrast into the thecal sac and filling of
the nerve roots. There is posterior fusion with bilateral rods and
pedicle screws of the L4 and L5 levels. A broken cerclage wire is
noted along the lateral aspect of the instrumentation hardware on the
left. Initial myelogram images demonstrate a grade I anterolisthesis
of L4 on L5.

CT myelogram re-demonstrates the interval laminectomies at the L4 and
5 levels since the prior examination. There is increased
anterolisthesis at L4-5 when compared to the prior exam, still grade
I. However, there is no change with either flexion or extension,
although note was made that there was limited motion between
flexion/extension views.

At the L1-2 level, there is no central canal stenosis or neural
foraminal narrowing.

At L2-3, there is minimal broad-based disk bulge, without significant
spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.

At L3-4, there is bilateral facet hypertrophy and mild spinal canal
stenosis, both of which are not changed in the interval. The neural
foramen appear unremarkable.

At L4-5, there has been a laminectomy at the L4 level. There are
bilateral pedicle screws, whose tips extend beyond the cortical
margins within the paravertebral soft tissues. There is a fragmented
left cerclage wire still in place. There is bilateral soft tissue
within the neural foramen at the L4-5 level. It contacts the
bilateral exiting L4 nerve roots at this level.

At L5-S1, there has been a laminectomy at L5. The AP diameter of the
spinal canal is increased, secondary to spondylolysis and
spondylolisthesis. Bilateral pedicle screws again identified, which
extend upon the cortical margins, right greater than left. The right
pedicle screw extends approximately 9 mm past the level of the
cortical margin.

There is a noted previous right iliac bone donor graft site.

There is bilateral paravertebral muscle atrophy.

instrumentation at the L4 and L5 levels.

2. New soft tissue within the bilateral L4-5 neural foramen, which
may represent post-operative scar/granulation tissue, contacting the

is resultant bilateral mild-moderate L4-5 neuroforaminal narrowing.
There does not appear to be significant change in the degree of
anterolisthesis with flexion or extension, but note is made that
there was limited patient mobility with flexion and extension.

CLINICAL HISTORY: An 89-year-old male, with a history of right
radiculopathy to the right buttock and the right leg. Central canal
stenosis, status post spinal fusion at L4-5 on 9/22/01. Now with
intermittent worsening radicolith pain since surgery.

TECHNIQUE: After the relative risks and benefits of the procedure
were explained to the patient, an informed written consent was
obtained and placed in the chart.

With the patient prone, the L4-5 central laminectomy was localized
under fluoroscopy. This area was prepped and draped in the usual
sterile fashion using Betadine solution. 1% lidocaine was used to
achieve local anesthesia. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 22-gauge
spinal needle was used to percutaneously access the L4-5 subarachnoid
space. Upon the return of clear CSF, approximately 9 cc of Omnipaque-
240 was manually infused. The spinal needle was then removed.
Multiple spot films were obtained in AP, RAO and LAO projections. The
patient was then taken to the CT scanner.

2.5 mm contiguous axial images were then obtained from T12-L1 to the
sacrum. Thin section coronal and sagittal reformations were also
performed. An initial AP and lateral lumbar spine radiograph were
also obtained.

FINDINGS: There is dextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine, centering at
L1. Endovascular aortobi-femoral graft is identified.

At T12-L1, a left paracentral posterior marginal osteophyte is
identified, with mild flattening of the ventral aspect of the thecal
sac. There is no evidence of significant central canal stenosis or
neural foraminal narrowing.

At L1-2, there is minimal posterior broad-based disc bulge without
evidence of significant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal
narrowing.

At L2-3, there is a posterior broad-based disc bulge, with vacuum
phenomenon related to degenerative changes. The posterior broad-based
disc bulge, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and bilateral facet
arthropathy cause infra-foraminal narrowing, and mild effacement of
the left lateral recess, and probable impingement of the traversing
left L3 nerve root. The central canal and the right neural foramen
are adequately patent.

At L4-5 and L5-S1, there is no evidence of central canal stenosis or
neural foraminal narrowing.

There has been prior posterior spinal fusion at L4-5, with
paired pedicle screws. L4 and L5 central laminectomies are present.
There is also a vacuum phenomenon at L5-S1, compatible with
degenerative changes. A linear bony defect compatible with
spondylolysis is identified at the right L5 laminar.

Informed consent was obtained from the patient including discussing
the risks and benefits of the procedure. These included the risks of
hemorrhage, infection, CSF leak, nerve damage, contrast reaction, and
other unforeseeable complications. The patient fully understood the
risks and benefits and was willing to proceed.

The patient was placed in a prone position and prepped and draped in
the usual sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was achieved with 1%
lidocaine. Using a 22 gauge spinal needle, the thecal sac was
accessed at the L5-S1 level under fluoroscopic guidance. Free flow
of contrast material into the thecal sac was seen. Multiple spot
images were obtained. The patient was subsequently transferred to
the CT scan where 3 mm axial images were obtained from the T12-L1
level through the sacrum. Sagittal and coronal reformations are also
submitted.

FINDINGS:

Lumbosacral alignment demonstrates an accentuated lordosis. There is
grade I spondylolisthesis at the L4-5 level with narrowing of the
spinal canal. Loss of disk space height is present at the L4-5 and
L5-S1 levels with vacuum disk phenomenon seen at the L5-S1 region.
A bulky, right-sided, bridging osteophyte is present at the L4-5
level with more minor osteophytosis seen in the lower lumbar spine.
Osteopenia is present without evidence for focal lytic or blastic
lesions.

The conus medullaris terminates at the T12-L1 level and appears
normal morphologically. Incidental note is made of vascular
calcifications of the aorta. No other soft tissue abnormalities are
appreciated.

Axial images demonstrate the following:

L2-3: No evidence for disk protrusion/extrusion or central canal
stenosis. The neural foramina remain patent. Ligamentum flavum
thickening is present with minor facet hypertrophy.

L3-4: No evidence for disk protrusion/extrusion, nor neural
foraminal narrowing. Ligamentum flavum thickening and facet
hypertrophy result in mild spinal stenosis. There is a possible left
hemilaminotomy.

L4-5: Grade I spondylolisthesis is seen with central canal narrowing
which is moderate to severe in nature. This appears to be secondary
to bony osteophytosis. There was no evidence of blockage of contrast
flow at this level during the procedure. A suggestion of left-sided
spondylolysis is present with a thin, subtle lucency seen in the pars
articularis. Moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing is
present, left greater than right. Marked facet hypertrophy is
identified. A component of this proliferative bone may represent
fusion graft and clinical correlation is requested.

L5-S1: No evidence for central canal stenosis is present. There is
severe facet hypertrophy resulting in moderate to severe bilateral
neural foraminal narrowing. A right hemilaminectomy is present.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Abnormal bone scan, rule out Paget's disease or
metastases. Note that the patient's clinical history was
discussed with Dr. Alan Newman. The patient has increased uptake on
bone scan in the thoracolumbar spine and evidence of Paget's on plain
film at the L5 level and involving the left pelvis and femur.
Request is to evaluate the thoracolumbar spine.

TECHNIQUE:

5 mm direct axial images of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained
from the level of T9 caudally. Sagittal and coronal reformatted
images were also obtained.

FINDINGS:

There are degenerative changes with end-plate irregularity and vacuum
disk phenomenon noted at T12/L1, L1/L2, and L5/S1.

Evaluation of the thoracolumbar spine by levels reveals the
following:

T9/T10: The T10 vertebral body demonstrates a mostly sclerotic
abnormality involving the left side of the vertebral body and
pedicle. There is a vacuum disk phenomenon noted at this level with
irregular end-plate changes. A pacemaker is noted within the heart
which is visualized in the anterior aspect of the field. The neural
foramina and central canal are patent.

T10/T11: The T11 vertebral body also demonstrates a diffusely mixed
sclerotic and lytic picture which involves the posterior elements.
There is a coarsened trabecular pattern most suggestive of Paget's
disease. Again the neural foramina and central canal are patent.

T11/T12: The T12 vertebral body does not appear to be involved by
this process. The neural foramina and central canal are widely
patent.

T12/L1: There are degenerative end-plate changes noted and vacuum
disk phenomenon. The L1 vertebral body demonstrates coarsening and
mottled expansion, compatible with Paget's disease. The neural
foramina and central canal are patent.

L1/L2: Again, the L1 vertebral body is coarsened with a mixed
sclerotic and lytic appearance and trabecular thickening. The L2
vertebral body is not involved. The neural foramina and central
canal are patent.

L2/L3, L3/L4: The vertebral bodies and marrow space are unremarkable
and uninvolved. The central canal and neural foramina are patent.

L4/L5: A broad-based disk bulge is present resulting in mild
anterior compression of the thecal sac. There is no significant
central stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. The L5 vertebral
body will be discussed below.

L5/S1: There are marked degenerative changes at this level with
vacuum disk phenomenon and severe end-plate changes.
Spondylolisthesis is present with bilateral spondylolysis (pars
interarticularis defects).

The L5 vertebral body demonstrates a similar pattern to those
described above with bilateral coarsening of the trabecular pattern
within the vertebral bodies and a mixed sclerotic and lytic picture.
At this level, the posterior elements are clearly involved including
the pedicles, lamina and spinous process. There is some suggestion
that the left iliac bone is also involved.

The global picture above suggests polyostotic Paget's disease. There
is no frank cortical disruption at any level. Clinical
collaboration, however, is essential. If the patient has a known
malignancy, certainly a sclerotic or lytic metastatic focus could be
hidden within these multi-focal abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:

1. Coarsening of the trabecular pattern as well as mixed sclerotic
and lytic abnormalities involving T10, T11, L1, and L5. The
abnormality in the T10 vertebral body is more sclerotic and more
localized to the left hemi-vertebral body. The global impression
strongly favors polyostotic Paget's disease. However, clinical
correlation is required as a lytic or sclerotic metastatic focus
within these abnormalities could not be entirely excluded based on
radiographic criteria alone.

2. Degenerative changes of the spine are noted with end-plate
irregularity and disk desiccation and vacuum disk phenomenon at
T9/T10, T12/L1, L1/L2, and L5-S1.

3. L5-S1 spondylolisthesis with bilateral spondylolysis (bilateral
pars interarticularis defects).

hypertrophy. The right neural foramen is probably satisfactory.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 72-year-old male status post lumbar fusion with
radiculopathy.

TECHNIQUE:

The benefits and risks of the lumbar spine myelogram were fully
explained to the patient who understood and wished to proceed.
Written informed consent was obtained.

The patient was placed in a supine position upon the fluoroscopy
table and the patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual
aseptic fashion. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 22 gauge spinal
needle was advanced into the thecal sac at L3-4. Upon brisk return
of clear cerebral spinal fluid, approximately 10 cc's of Omnipaque
240 were injected without complication.

The patient was brought to the CT scanner and contiguous axial 3
millimeter images were obtained through the lumbar spine from T12-L1
through L5-S1. Sagittal and coronal reformations were also
performed.

COMPARISON: No prior studies.

FINDINGS:

There has been prior lumbar spine surgery with Dow coils in the L4-5
and L5-S1 intervertebral disc spaces. A grade I anterolisthesis of
L4 on L5 is identified. The remainder of the vertebral bodies are
aligned. Mild loss of vertebral body height is identified at L5.
Coronal reformatted images demonstrate a mild lumbar scoliosis convex
to the right with the apex at L4-5.

Axial interrogation demonstrates the following:

At T12-L1, there is a minimal, broad disc bulge which does not result
in significant spinal stenosis or neural foraminal compromise.

At L1-2, the conus terminates at this level. A broad disc-osteophyte
is identified which results in mild central canal stenosis, effacing
the ventral thecal sac. A vacuum disc is also present at this level.
There is mild narrowing of the inferior neural foramina bilaterally.

At L2-3, a broad and left paracentral and lateral disc bulge is
identified which in combination with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy
result in mild to moderate central canal stenosis and mild narrowing
of the bilateral neural foramina inferiorly.

At L3-4, a broad disc/osteophyte complex in combination with
ligamentum flavum hypertrophy results in mild to moderate central
canal stenosis. There may be some mild narrowing of the right neural
foramen, with mild narrowing of the inferior left neural foramen.
At L4-5, two dow coils are present within the intervertebral disc
space. There is a broad disc protrusion which in combination with
bilateral facet hypertrophic changes results in severe narrowing of
the central canal and both neural foramina, contacting the exiting
L4 nerve roots bilaterally.

At L5-S1, bilateral laminotomies and bilateral spondylolysis are
identified. Two intervertebral dow coils are present at this level.
A broad disc/osteophyte complex is present. However, due to the
widening of the spinal canal in the AP diameter from the
spondylolisthesis, there is no significant spinal canal stenosis.
There is moderate narrowing of the left neural foramen and mild to
moderate narrowing of the right neural foramen.

Vascular calcifications involve the abdominal aorta and iliac
arteries.

FINDINGS:

For the purpose of this report, L5/S1, is considered the last
lumbar type disk space. There are 5 non-rib bearing lumbar
vertebral bodies.

Vertebral body heights are maintained with reactive endplate
changes, including subchondral cyst formation and osteophytosis
at L5/S1, secondary to severe degenerative disease. Findings are
likely posttraumatic or dysplastic in etiology.

Disk spaces are maintained throughout the lumbar spine from
T12/L1 to L3/L4. There is minimal loss of L4/L5 disk height.
Severe degeneration and likely anterior extrusion of the L5/S1
disk space is noted with associated vacuum phenomenon.

Evaluation of the paraspinal and retroperitoneal structures
demonstrates nephrolithiasis of the right kidney, but no evidence
of hydronephrosis or stranding. Scattered vascular
calcifications are noted throughout the aorta.

L1-L2: No canal or foraminal stenosis.

L2-L3: No canal or foraminal stenosis.

L3-L4: No canal or foraminal stenosis.

L4-L5: Minimal degenerative disk bulge with facet degeneration,
but no canal or foraminal stenosis.

L5-S1: Grade 2 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 with associated
degenerative pars inter-articularis defects. Severe sharp
changes are noted at the facet. There severe bilateral
neuroforaminal stenosis, but no significant spinal canal
stenosis.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year-old male with history of relapsed AML,
anemia, and thrombocytopenia, status post transfusions.
Reportedly six unsuccessful attempts at lumbar puncture at the
bedside, request for image guided diagnostic lumbar puncture.
Given the possible presence of iatrogenic hematomas complicating
a fluoroscopically guided puncture, a CT guided puncture was
scheduled.

PROCEDURE:

Available prior imaging was reviewed. The CT guided lumbar
procedure and its risks, benefits and alternatives were frankly
discussed with the patient, and all questions were fully
answered. Written informed consent was obtained for the medical
record, and a formal ""time out"" procedure was performed per UCSF
protocol, verifying the correct patient, procedure, and procedure
site.

Positioned prone in the CT scanner, a suitable trajectory for
access to the thecal sac was identified. The overlying skin was
prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion and then
anesthetized via local infiltration of approximately 5 cc 1%
lidocaine buffered 1:1 with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate. Under
fluoroscopic guidance, a 22-gauge 9 cm spinal needle was advanced
into the thecal sac via a right parasagittal interlaminar
approach at the L4-5 level. Upon return of clear-colored CSF, a
total of 14 cc was sampled and the needle was removed.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no
apparent immediate complications.

FINDINGS:

Targeted CT scan obtained for needle targeting/guidance
demonstrates tiny foci of air in the left lateral epidural space
at L3 and stranding in the overlying paraspinal soft tissues,
presumably related to the recent bedside attempts at lumbar
puncture. No appreciable epidural hematoma. Bilateral L5 pars

CLINICAL HISTORY: 35-year-old male with lower back pain and
bilateral L5 spondylolysis.

TECHNIQUE: The patient was informed of the risks and benefits of
the procedure and wished to proceed. An informed written consent
was obtained prior to the procedure. The patient was then taken to
the fluoroscopy department and placed in a prone position on the
fluoroscopy table. The lower lumbar spine was prepped and draped
in the usual sterile fashion. Under fluoroscopy, a left lateral
approach was chosen and marked with a marking pen at the
appropriate L4-5 and L5-S1 disc levels. One percent buffered
lidocaine was infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous and deep
soft tissues in the expected track of the needle. A coaxial system
was utilized. This consisted of a 19 gauge, 10 cm guide needle,
which was placed under fluoroscopic guidance from a left
posterolateral position towards the midline directed at the
appropriate disc space. This was performed first at the L4-5
level. Once this 19 gauge needle was in position, the stylet was
removed and a 22 gauge, 14 cm Chiba needle was placed in a coaxial
manner through the 19 gauge needle, also targeting the disc space.
The Chiba needle was advanced to the margin of the disc. AP
projection was then obtained while the needle was advanced into the
disc space. A lateral projection confirmed that the tip of the
needle was in the anterior-mid disc in appropriate position. At
this point this process was repeated for the L5-S1 position. One
gram of Ancef was suspended in 9 mL of saline for a total of 10 mL.
This was placed into a bowel on the back table. To this, 20 mL of
Omnipaque 240 mg was added. This was then drawn up into a syringe
with a manometer. Then in sequential fashion the L4-5 and then the
L5-S1 disc spaces were injected. At the L4-5 level, 2 mL of this
mixture was injected with a maximum pressure reached of 60 psi. No
pain was provoked during the injection. No extravasation was seen.
The L5-S1 was then injected with a total of 3 mL at a maximum
pressure of 20 psi. The patient reported pain during the injection
with a maximum intensity of 7 out of 10. Concordance was reported
to be 5 out of 10 with respect to mimicking his known lower back
pain. The pain was non-radiating and in the lower back, feeling
like ""pressure"". No pain was experienced down either leg during
the injections. 1 mL of bupivacaine (0.75%) was then injected into
the L5-S1 level for local anesthetic. The patient was removed from
the fluoroscopy table and transferred by gurney to the CT table for
a postprocedure non-contrast CT exam of the lumbar spine.
Following this, the patient was transferred to the holding area for
recovery.

During the discogram, monitored IV sedation was provided by a
registered UCSF nurse.

One hour following the procedure, at the time of discharge, the
patient reported that his pain was greater than usual in his lower
back.

FINDINGS: AP and lateral spot films of the lower lumbar spine
following injection of the disc spaces at the time of the discogram
revealed contrast in the anterior mid aspect of the L4-5 disc space
without extravasation. There is narrowing of the L5-S1 disc space
and linear extension of the contrast from the mid aspect of the
disc to the left anterolateral margin of the disc, consistent with
an annular tear.

CT FINDINGS: Non-contrast CT examination was performed from the
mid T12 level to include the sacrum. Postprocessing of the images
was performed to yield interval 1.25 mm axial images, 0.6 mm
coronal and 0.6 mm interval sagittal images.

L1-2: Unremarkable.

L2-3: Unremarkable.

L3-4: Unremarkable.

L4-5: Contrast is noted in the anterior mid aspect of the disc
space. There is a mild broad-based posterior disc bulge without a
tear. A small posterior midline mild disc protrusion is seen
without significant spinal canal stenosis. Minimal ligamentum
flavum buckling and the broad-based disc bulge results in mild left
foraminal stenosis.

L5-S1: Contrast is seen within the L5-S1 disc, extending in a
linear manner to the left anterolateral margin of the disc,
consistent with a full thickness annular tear. At the margin of
the disc, the contrast extends both anteriorly and posteriorly.
There is filling of a left posterolateral disc protrusion and, in
combination with ligamentum flavum buckling, results in moderate
left neural foraminal stenosis. There is a mild broad-based disc
bulge at this level, which, in combination with right ligamentum
flavum buckling, results in mild right neural foraminal stenosis.
No spinal canal stenosis is present. Bilateral pars defects
are seen at the L5 level. This does not result in any
anterolisthesis.

low back pain 1 week ago, with radiation to the hips and buttocks,
and elevated sed rate (ESR greater than 100). The patient is
currently not on antibiotic therapy. Asked to perform disc
aspiration for evaluation of symptoms and recent MR imaging
demonstrating new fluid in the L4-5 disc space.

TECHNIQUE:

The risks and benefits of this procedure were discussed with the
patient and her nephew who was present for the discussion. Their
questions were answered and they understood the discussion. The
patient and her nephew gave written informed consent for CT guided
lumbar disc aspiration.

The patient was placed prone on the fluoroscopy table. 2.5 mm
collimation CT imaging was performed for localization purposes.
The skin entry site was marked, prepped and draped in the usual

176,"CT-GUIDED LUMBAR EPIDURAL BLOOD PATCH: 07/27/06

CLINICAL HISTORY: 67-year-old woman status post recent surgery for
presumed large meningioma with low intracranial pressure. The
patient's brain MRI demonstrates some features of intracranial
hypotension, although some of the slumping and mass effect of the
mid brain could also be related to postoperative edema and extra-
axial collection underlying the craniotomy site. Because the
patient had an indwelling lumbar drain, the referring neural
surgeon requests the performance of an epidural blood patch.

TECHNIQUE: A detailed discussion of the procedure was undertaken
with the patient and her daughter Tina specifically addressing
risks, benefits, and alternatives. Following ample opportunity to
answer any of her daughters remaining questions, written informed
consent was witnessed and documented in the medial record with her
daughter signing on her behalf, as the patient was alert, but still
intubated.

The patient was placed in the prone position on the CT gantry and
the region surrounding her lower back was prepped and draped in the
usual sterile fashion. Noncontrast CT of the lumbar spine using
2.5 mm collimation was performed for localization purposes. The
right L3-4 interlaminar space was localized with CT and
approximately 5 cc of 1% Lidocaine was infiltrated subcutaneously
at the anticipated skin entry site. A 2.5 inch 22-gauge spinal
needle was inserted and advanced into the dorsal epidural fat at
this level under CT guidance. Once the epidural placement of the
needle tip was confirmed by the injection of approximately 1 cc of
air, 9 cc of the patient's blood was withdrawn through an
indwelling central venous line and was mixed with 1 cc of Omnipaque
180. A total of 8 cc of this contrast opacified blood mixture was
injected into the epidural space at this level with placement of
the infusion confirmed by limited CT. Because the amount of
contrast opacified blood only extended into the L4-5 epidural space
to a minimal degree, an identical set of procedures was undertaken
at the L4-5 level where a total of 7 cc of contrast opacified blood
was instilled into the dorsal epidural space. Following removal of
the spinal needles, sterile dressings were applied to the puncture
sites.

FINDINGS:

CT of the lumbar spine demonstrates no evidence of spinal stenosis
at any level. Incidental note is made of bilateral L5 pars intra-
articularis defects. The dorsal epidural fat at the L4-5 level
appears increased in attenuation relative to fat at other levels
suggestive of increased fluid content. More notably, suggestion
was made of increased edema and fluid content extending into the
adjacent paraspinous soft tissues. It was presumed that this was
the location of prior lumbar drain placement with the areas of
increased fluid content in the paraspinous and epidural fat
potentially reflective of a cerebrospinal fluid leak.

Limited CT performed during the procedure demonstrated placement of
a spinal needle initially at the right L3-4 interlaminar space with
the tip in the dorsal epidural fat and subsequently a second needle
placed at the right L4-5 interlaminar space. The epidural needle
placement was confirmed by the injection of a small amount of air
at both of these levels. Repeat CT during the course of the
examination demonstrated contrast opacified blood mixture within
the dorsal epidural space at L3-4 extending slightly cranially and
caudally. Following the second injection at L4-5, the contrast
opacified blood mixture was seen filling much of the dorsal and

FINDINGS:

The patient is status-post posterior and anterior fusion of L5-S1.
An L5 laminectomy is noted. Alignment and vertebral body heights
are within normal limits.

There is fragmentation of the L5-S1 paraspinal bone graft
bilaterally compatible with bilateral pseudarthroses. There is

COMPARISON: Plain radiographs of 06/16/2006.

Normal alignment is maintained. Moderate arthropathy is present at
L4-5 disc space. There is characterized by endplate sclerosis and
irregularity and significant disc height loss. The findings are
most likely degenerative in nature, but in the correct clinical
setting, infection cannot be fully ruled out.

No evidence of pars defects are identified in the lower lumbar
spine.

T12-L1, L1-L2: Normal.

L2-L3: A mild broad-based disc bulge is present resulting in
minimal spinal stenosis.

L3-L4: A moderate disc bulge combines with mild buckling of the
ligamentum flavum to result in mild-to-moderate stenosis at this
level. The disc bulge is slight asymmetric to the left and comes
close to contacting the exiting left nerve root, although small
amounts of fat does surround the nerve root.

L4-L5: Again, moderate-to-advanced changes involve this disc space
with a large associated broad-based disc bulge and a probable
superimposed protrusion. This combines with moderate facet
hypertrophy and buckling of the ligamentum flavum to result in
moderate-to-severe stenosis. The broad-based disc bulge and
osteophytes also likely contact the exiting L4 nerve roots
bilaterally.

L5-S1: A broad-based disc bulge is present. In addition, marked
arthropathy is noted at the L5-S1 facet joint on the right left.
This results in significant narrowing of the foramen on the left
with probable involvement of the exiting L5 nerve root. Mild
spinal stenosis is also present at this level.

A large cystic mass is seen in the lower pole of the right kidney
which measures approximately 5.5 x 4.0 cm. This should be further
evaluated with ultrasound. In addition, numerous small nodes are
noted around the periaortic region measuring approximately 5.0 mm
in short axis. Stranding is also noted.

CLINICAL DATA: 15-year-old male with low back pain.

TECHNIQUE:

Contiguous 1.25 mm axial sections of the lumbar spine were obtained
from T12 to the lower sacrum. Subsequently sagittal and coronal
reformations were produced.

FINDINGS:

The sagittal reformations of the lumbar spine demonstrates mild,
Grade I retrolisthesis of L5 on S1. The remainder of the lumbar
spine demonstrates normal alignment. There is no evidence of
scoliosis. The sacroiliac joints are likewise within normal
limits. The bone structure is normal for the patient's age.
Neural foramina in both sides are widely patent.

However, broad-based disk bulges are noted posteriorly at L3-4, L4-
5 and L5-S1 with some effacement of the ventral cerebrospinal fluid
spaces.

In addition, there is mild facet joint irregularity and sclerosis
at multiple lumbar levels compatible with degenerative change.

Analysis of the axial levels demonstrates normal findings at T12-
L1, L1-2 and L2-3. At L3-4 a broad-based disk bulge was noted
which was also seen on the sagittal views without significant
effacement of the spinal canal or neural foramina.

TECHNIQUE:

The patient was counseled regarding the indications, risks,
benefits and alternatives to fluoroscopy guided discogram. The
patient expressed her understanding, had all of her questions
answered and wishes to proceed. She then gave written informed
consent. She was placed on the fluoroscopy table in the prone
position. Due to equipment problems, this was performed in a CR
room with a portable C-Arm for fluoroscopy. The back was assessed
with real-time fluoroscopy and the levels were determined. Initial
site in the left paraspinal approach at the L3-L4 levels selected
and marked. The back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
fashion. 1% lidocaine was used for superficial and deep anesthesia
at the access site. I.V. conscious sedation was provided by
registered nurse with Versed and fentanyl. Dr. Chin, the attending
physician, supervised the conscious sedation throughout the entire
case. Under direct fluoroscopic guidance, a 19 gauge 10 cm
introducer was then placed in the left paravertebral soft tissues
at the L3-L4 disc level and using coaxial technique, a 22 gauge, 20
cm Chiba needle was advanced through the introducer in the
paravertebral soft tissues into the L3-L4 disc space. Similarly,
this was repeated for the L4-L5 disc level. The L5-S1 disc level
was not technically feasible due to the room constraint and the
grade two to three spondylolisthesis, which created unfavorable
angles.

At each of the two lumbar levels, Omnipaque 180 contrast media, as
well as Ancef was injected under fluoroscopic observation with pain
provocation utilizing manometry. The volume of contrast at each
levels as well as the pressure and pounds per square inch were
noted. The patient was asked if she experienced any pain, and
whether the pain was similar to her baseline pain, as well as how
intense the pain was.

After examination of the two levels, the spinal needles were then
removed from the patient and AP and lateral radiographs were
obtained. The patient was then transferred to the CT scanner for

CT MYELOGRAM AND LUMBAR PUNCTURE: 11/05/2004

CLINICAL DATA: The patient is a 31-year-old female with a history
of chronic low back pain and radiculopathy status post posterior
fusion of an L5-S1 grade III spondylolysis/listhesis on 11/2/2004.
Presents now with new onset left lower extremity weakness not present
prior to surgery.

TECHNIQUE:

After the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained,
informed consent was obtained.

The patient was laid in the prone position on the fluoroscopic table.
The skin overlying the lumbar region was then sterilized using
Betadine solution. The L2-3 interspace was then localized under
fluoroscopy. The patient was placed in a slightly oblique position.
The skin overlying the L2-3 interspace was then anesthetized using 1%
lidocaine. Using a 20 g spinal needle, the thecal sac at this level
was accessed. The intrathecal location of the needle tip was
confirmed first by seeing cerebrospinal fluid flow freely through the
needle hub, and secondly by demonstrating quick diffusion of injected
contrast under fluoroscopy. Omnipaque 240 was utilized. 10 cubic
centimeters were injected. The patient was placed in the reverse
Trendelenburg position for approximately 10 minutes before CT
scanning.

The patient was then sent to the scanner without significant
complaints. Two CT scans of the lumbar spine were obtained. The
second in a delayed fashion (1 hour). Reconstructions in the coronal
and sagittal planes were also obtained.

FINDINGS:

The patient is status post L4-S1 fusion. Pedicle screws at the L4
levels are noted traversing the L4 pedicles bilaterally. The second
pair of screws enters the S1 vertebral body and terminates within the
L5 vertebral body anteriorly.

Laminectomies of the L5 and S1 levels are noted. Lateral bony fusion
material is noted at the L4-L5 and S1 levels laterally.

Best illustrated on the sagittal reconstructed images, a Grade II-III
spondylolisthesis is appreciated which is unchanged in extent when
compared to prior MRI dated 3/10/2004.

Best appreciated on series 114 image 26, an epidural soft tissue
process is seen which causes mass effect upon the thecal sac
posteriorly and to the left. This process starts at the level of the
L3 vertebral body, producing moderate to severe canal stenosis at the
L4-5 level.

No definitive intrathecal contrast is noted from the L4-5 level to
L5-S1. The absence of intrathecal contrast is likely secondary to
mass effect from both the epidural process and the L5-S1
spondylolisthesis. However, this is not a complete block as
intrathecal contrast is noted within the S2 nerve root sleeves.

The L5-S1 neural foramina bilaterally demonstrates severe narrowing.


IMPRESSION:

1. Delayed 1 hour images demonstrate an incomplete myelographic
block from L4-5 to L5-S1 secondary to a left posterolateral epidural

The procedure was discussed in detail with the patient including
risks of bleeding, infection, nerve root/spinal cord injury, contrast
allergy, contrast nephropathy, myelographic headache or other
unforeseen adverse event. Patient stated she understood and wished
to proceed. Written informed consent was obtained and placed in the
chart.

Patient stated she is not taking anticoagulant medications and did
not have a significant problem with bleeding (prior to lumbar
surgeries without bleeding abnormalities).

TECHNIQUE:

In the prone position, the L2-3 interspace was localized with
fluoroscopy. After marking this space, the back was prepped and
draped in standard sterile fashion. Following infiltration of 1%
local anesthesia, a 22 gauge spinal needle was placed via the L2-3
interspace until the needle was in the thecal sac. Intrathecal
location was verified by return of clear CSF. Approximately 13 cc
Omnipaque non-ionic 180 contrast was slowly injected. Contrast was
seen to clear from the needle tip and progressively opacified the
thecal sac from inferior to superior, again indicating intrathecal
location. The needle was removed. The back was cleaned with
hydrogen proxide and a Band-Aid placed.

No immediate complications. Dr. David Norman was present for the
procedure.

AP and bilateral oblique fluoroscopic spot images were obtained of
the lumbar spine. Subsequently, axial images were obtained in the CT
scanner from T12-L1 to the sacrum, 3 mm x 3 mm. Axial images angled
to fit the L5-S1 level were obtained with 1.25 mm x 1.25 mm
collimation to minimize hardware artifact. Sagittal and coronal

After the tip of the needle was confirmed under fluoroscopy,
approximately 2.4 cc of Kefzol and Omnipaque 240 was manually infused
into the disk using a manometer. The pain intensity and the
concordance was elicited from the patient. The Chiba needle was then
removed.

The patient asked that the procedure be terminated early as he could
not tolerate additional pain. He was advised that he could return at
a future date to have additional levels performed with conscious
sedation.

AP and lateral views of the lower lumbar spine were obtained. The
patient was then taken to the CT scanner where helical axial images
of 2.5-mm were obtained from L4 to the sacrum. Thin-section
reformations angled to the disks at L4-5 and L5-S1 were obtained. In
addition, thin-section sagittal and coronal reformations were
obtained.

CLINICAL DATA: Injury to the lower back from falling gymnastic
equipment in 1982, treated with body cast for 3 months, without
complete healing. Numbness in both legs appeared 10 years later in
1992, and Dr. Bradford performed posterior fusion and decompression.
The patient remained asymptomatic until 18 months ago when he began
to have numbness in the left buttock and bilateral posterior thighs
with return of low back pain. These symptoms have worsened. No
evidence of bowel, or bladder incontinence, or other sacral plexus
symptoms.

The patient has no history of known allergies, takes no significant
meds, and has no history of bleeding.

TECHNIQUE:

After discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives, including
the risks of bleeding, infection, nerve damage, seizure, and contrast
reaction, as well as the minor risks of headache and temporary
exacerbation of symptoms, informed consent was obtained and
documented in writing.

The patient was placed prone on the fluoroscopy table, and following
a sterile Betadine prep, sterile drape, and the subcutaneous and
subcuticular infusion of 10 cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine
for local analgesia, a 9 cm, 22 gauge spinal needle was advanced
under intermittent fluoroscopic guidance into the thecal sac by a
midline L2-3 approach with a single pass. After confirming with free
return of CSF, 10 cc of Omnipaque-300 intrathecal contrast was
infused under direct fluoroscopic guidance. AP, oblique and lateral
views were obtained, and the patient was transferred to CT where a
spiral CT with 2.5 mm collimation was performed from the level of
mid-T11 through S2 with the patient in the supine position. Sagittal
and coronal reformatted images were produced.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area and observed for 2
hours. After diminution of his temporary exacerbation of leg
symptoms, his symptoms returned to baseline, and he was discharged.


The teaching physician, James Barkovich, M.D., was present throughout
the critical portion of the procedure, and reviewed the images
produced.

FINDINGS:

AP and lateral views of the lumbar spine prior to the procedure
demonstrate loss of disc height at L4-5 since 12-22-00. The
approximately 1 cm anterolisthesis of L4 on L5, and broken posterior
cerclage wires with posterior element hypertrophy have not changed
significantly since 12-22-00. The alignment is intact as are the
posterior elements and vertebral bodies above the L4-5 level.

Myelographic views demonstrate filling of a small left S1 Tarlov
cyst. The S1 nerve roots fill normally. The L5 nerve roots also
fill below the disc. The right L4 nerve root fills below the disc.
The left L4 nerve root fills to the level of the disc, but not below.


Reformatted images from the CT acquired in the supine position
demonstrate near-complete reduction of the grade I anterolisthesis at
L4-5. There is discontinuity of the pars interarticularis on both
sides at L4-5, in the area where the cerclage wires are seen. A
small amount of morcellized bone graft material is present. No bony
fusion is present.

Facet hypertrophy is noted at a number of other levels, however, the
facet alignment, pars interarticularis, posterior elements, vertebral
bodies, and vertebral alignment are normal at the other evaluated
levels from T11 through L4.

Evaluation at individual levels as follows:

T11-12: Normal caliber neural foramina and central canal.

T12-L1: Normal caliber central canal and neural foramina.

L1-L1: Bilateral facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy
without significant stenosis.

L2-L3: Ligamentum flavum and facet hypertrophy without significant
stenosis.

L3-L4: Facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and mild broad-based
disc bulge do not significantly narrow the central canal or neural
foramina. Nerve root filling is seen below the disc on both sides.

L4-L5: Mild broad-based disc bulge and uncovered disc with prominent
facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy on both sides is associated
with a small amount of reduced filling of the left nerve root in
association with the mild disc compression.

L5-S1: Normal caliber neural foramina and central canal.

STUDY:  CT LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST  8/18/2015 1:06 PM
CLINICAL HISTORY: History of lower back pain.
COMPARISON:  MRI lumbar spine and PET/CT from outside hospital.
TECHNIQUE:  Helical CT images of the lumbar spine were obtained without contrast. Axial, sagittal and coronal reconstructions were performed.
RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS:
MUKESH NATH received 1 exposure event(s) (excluding scout) during this CT study. The CTDIvol (mGy) and DLP (mGy-cm) radiation dose values for each event are:
Event: 1;  anatomic area: L Spine;  phantom: body;  CTDIvol: 21.6;  DLP: 636.8
The dose indicators for CT are the volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIvol) and the Dose Length Product (DLP), and are measured in units of mGy and mGy-cm, respectively. These indicators are not patient dose, but values generated from the CT scanner acquisition factors.  Individual patient doses calculated from these values will depend on patient size and can substantially underestimate or overestimate the actual dose.

FINDINGS:  There is loss of height and increased sclerosis of the L3 vertebral body and posterior elements with a focal sclerotic lesion within the ventral body, unchanged from the prior exam, and not correlating with increased FDG activity on recent PET/CT. On coronal views, striations are visualized within the L3 vertebral body. Sclerosis of the S2 and superior aspect of the S3 vertebral bodies extending to the posterior elements are partially visualized on this exam.
The remainder of the vertebral body heights are normal.  Multilevel degenerative changes are identified with disc vacuum phenomena seen at L3/L4, L4/L5, and L5/S1. Bilateral spondylolysis of L5.
L1-L2:  Mild bilateral facet arthropathy with narrowing of the left neuroforamen.
L2-L3:  Patent neural foramina bilaterally.
L3-L4:  Bilateral facet arthropathy with moderate to severe neuroforaminal narrowing bilaterally.
L4-L5:  Bilateral facet arthropathy with mild neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally.

1.  Again seen is sclerosis of the L3 vertebral body loss of height, which suggests compression.  These findings do not correlate with increased FDG activity on recent PET/CT. Additional sclerosis of the S2 and superior aspect of the S3 vertebral bodies extending to the posterior elements is partially imaged on this exam. Striations seen on coronal view within the L3 vertebral body suggest a possible hemangioma. However no striations are seen at S2 or S3.  Paget's disease (a benign condition causing sclerotic bone) cannot be excluded and, if clinically indicated, a nuclear medicine bone scan is recommended to potentially confirm this.

Technique: Helical CT of the lumbar spine at 1.25 mm thickness
with sagittal/coronal reformation.

Findings: Lumbar spine CT reveals severe multilevel degenerative
disc disease with severe multilevel spinal canal stenosis. There
is a compression fracture at T12 with approximately 50% loss of
anterior vertebral body height. This fracture is chronic in
appearance with anterior bridging osteophytes at the adjacent
disc spaces. There are five non-rib-bearing lumbar vertebrae with
partial sacralization of the L5 vertebral body. Degenerative
hypertrophy of the spinous processes is noted as well (a.k.a.
Baastrup's disease). While there is bilateral spondylolysis at
L5, there is no spondylolisthesis or degenerative disc disease at
L5-S1, due to partial sacralization of the L5 vertebral body.

CLINICAL HISTORY: A 48-year-old male status post L4-5 diskectomy
with progressive back pain and MR findings concerning for disk
osteomyelitis.

TECHNIQUE:

The benefits and risks of the CT-guided aspiration were explained
to the patient who understood and wished to proceed. Written
informed consent was obtained.

The patient was placed in a prone position upon the CT gantry, and
the patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic
fashion and locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine at the L4-5
level.

Under CT guidance, a co-axial system consisting of a 19-gauge 10-cm
Chiba needle through which 22-gauge 15-cm Chiba needles were
advanced through the right paraspinal, right psoas, and right
lateral L4-5 interspace.

Multiple specimens through the 22-gauge as well as the 19-gauge
Chiba needles were obtained and sent to microbiology for further
analysis.

The patient tolerated the procedure, and there were no immediate
complications.

FINDINGS:

As seen on the 12/29/2005 MRI from San Jose Imaging Center,
anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 with evidence of bilateral L4 and L5
lyses.

There is erosion of the L4-5 endplates with extension of increased
soft tissue into the bilateral paraspinal spaces with mass effect
upon the subjacent psoas muscles, right greater than left. This
was present on the prior outside MRI, although not seen in their
entirety. A small fluid/fluid level was present on the prior
outside MRI within the right paraspinal/psoas soft tissues.

There is no central low attenuation within the soft tissues on the
current CT scan to suggest gross abscess cavity. There is also
soft tissue extension anteriorly, displacing the adjacent aorta and
inferior vena cava.

Axial interrogation reveals the following:

At L2-3 and L3-4, there is mild canal narrowing on the basis of
mild broad disk osteophytes.

At L4-5, changes related to reported prior diskectomy with endplate
erosion, anterolisthesis, and bilateral L4 spondylolysis
identified. Circumferential paraspinal increased soft tissue
mildly displacing the bilateral psoas, left greater than right, as
well as the aorta and inferior vena cava identified without
evidence for central low attenuation to suggest abscess cavitation.
There is mild canal narrowing related to the anterolisthesis. The
foramina appear moderate to severely narrowed bilaterally related
to the anterolisthesis in combination with soft tissue extending
through the foramina as well.

At L5-S1 the canal is widely patent. There is mild anterolisthesis
of L5 on S1 with severe right and moderate left neuroforaminal
narrowing. There is bilateral L5 spondylolysis.

IMPRESSION:

1. Status post L4-5 diskectomy with endplate erosion and
associated near circumferential soft tissue extending bilaterally
into the psoas muscles, left greater than right, not completely
evaluated on the prior MRI. No central low attenuation on the
current CT scan within this paraspinal soft tissue to suggest gross
central cavitation as might be expected with an abscess cavity.

2. CT-guided aspiration utilizing 22-gauge and 19-gauge Chiba
needles with specimens to microbiology for further analysis without
immediate complication. Specimens were taken via a right
paraspinal approach through the right paraspinal/psoas soft tissues
as well as the L4-5 disk and endplate.

3. Evidence for bilateral L4 and L5 spondylolyses as well as L4-5
bilateral facet arthropathy with L4-5 anterolisthesis. Bilateral
L4-5 moderate to severe foraminal narrowing related to the
anterolisthesis in combination with paraspinal soft tissue.

4. The findings radiographically are concerning for a disk
osteomyelitis without evidence for gross abscess formation.
Conceivably the findings could represent postoperative change,
although the degree of paraspinal soft tissue is concerning for
possible infection. A followup MRI if aspiration specimens are
negative in 1-2 weeks may be helpful to document for progression.
In addition, repeat aspiration if the patient has remained off
antibiotics may also be of higher yield.

CLINICAL DATA: 45-year-old man with low back pain.

No comparison.

TECHNIQUE:

Contiguous axial 3 millimeter collimation images were obtained
through the lumbar spine. Coronal and axial reformations were
created from the raw axial data.

FINDINGS:

Alignment of the lumbar spine is within normal limits. Extensive
vacuum disc defect and disc/osteophyte complexes are observed at
L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1. Overall, CT yields a poor evaluation of nerve
roots and soft tissue structures, limiting this examination.

Findings at specific levels:

L1-2:

Unremarkable.

L2-3:

Mild broad based disc bulge resulting in mild spinal canal stenosis
but no significant neural foraminal narrowing.

L3-4:

Broad based disc bulge on the left greater than right resulting in
moderate spinal canal stenosis but no neural foraminal narrowing.

L4-5:

Inferior L4 vertebral body discogenic vertebral sclerosis is
observed. Bilateral lateral (foraminal and extra-foraminal) disc
protrusion resulting in bilateral severe neural foraminal narrowing
is observed. The nerve roots themselves cannot be visualized on this
study and mass effect on them is difficult to judge. No
spondylolysis is seen at this level. Moderate spinal canal stenosis
is evident at L4-5.

L5-S1:

Bilateral facet sclerosis without evidence of spondylolysis.
Bilateral disc foraminal protrusion resulting in moderate to severe
bilateral neural foraminal narrowing and mild spinal canal stenosis
is observed. Bilateral vacuum effect at the sacroiliac joints is
additionally noted.

Review of coronal data demonstrates Baastrup's disease at L2-3 and
L3-4 with close approach of the posterior spinous processes.

IMPRESSION:

1. Limited examination of the lumbar spine. If the patient is able
to, a magnetic resonance imaging examination could better evaluate
the relationship of nerve roots to soft tissue and bony structures.

2. Multilevel spinal canal stenosis most prominent at L3-4 and
L4-5.

3. Discogenic neural foraminal narrowing, most severe at L4-5

PROCEDURE:
Available prior imaging and the indications for myelography were reviewed. The
lumbar puncture and CT myelogram procedure and its risks, benefits and
alternatives were discussed with the patient, and all questions were fully
answered.  Written informed consent was obtained for the medical record, and a
formal ""time out"" procedure was performed per UCSF protocol, verifying the
correct patient, procedure, and procedure site.
Positioned left lateral decubitus on the CT table, a suitable trajectory for
access to the thecal sac was identified. The overlying skin was prepped and
draped in the usual aseptic fashion and then anesthetized via local infiltration
of approximately 5 cc 1% lidocaine. Under serial CT guidance, a 22-gauge spinal
needle was advanced into the thecal sac at the L3-4 level. Upon return of
clear-colored CSF, a small volume of Omnipaque-240 iodinated contrast contrast
was administered via the needle and observed to flow freely within the thecal
sac. 
Opening pressure was measured? no 
A total of 8 cc of the contrast agent was then administered for CT myelography.
The needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied. The patient was then
transferred from the CT table to a gurney and positioned to facilitate passage
of contrast. The patient was then positioned again on the CT scanner for
imaging. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no apparent
immediate complications.  
TECHNIQUE: Helical axial acquisition encompassing the lumbar spine,
reconstructed at 1.25 and reformatted in sagittal and coronal planes.

superior endplate of L5. The overlying skin was marked with a pen and 
prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. Local anesthesia was 
obtained by infiltration of approximately 5 mL 1% lidocaine at each marked 
site. 
Under intermittent CT guidance, a coaxial system using a 10 cm 11-gauge 
needle, through which a 14 cm 13-gauge needle was inserted, advanced to 
approximate the left superior endplate of L5. Upon CT confirmation of 
needle position, a core biopsy and several fine needle aspirations were 
performed. The sample was placed in the appropriate specimen containers 
for transport to the laboratory.
All needles were subsequently removed. The patient tolerated the procedure 
well, and was observed in the radiology holding area for one hour.  There 
were no apparent immediate complications.  
RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS: STANLEY A VANELLA received 25 exposure event(s) 
(excluding scout) during this CT study. The maximum CTDIvol was 10.85 
(mGy) and the TOTAL DLP was 304.96 (mGy-cm).
The dose indicators for CT are the volume Computed Tomography Dose Index 
(CTDIvol) and the Dose Length Product (DLP), and are measured in units of 
mGy and mGy-cm, respectively. These indicators are not patient dose, but 
values generated from the CT scanner acquisition factors.  Individual 
patient doses calculated from these values will depend on patient size and 
can substantially underestimate or overestimate the actual dose. For

FINDINGS:
A dedicated lumbar spine CT was performed prior to the initiation of the 
biopsy.
The final well-formed disc space is referred to is L5-S1 for the purposes 
of dictation.
Lumbar vertebral body heights are maintained. Multilevel loss of 
intervertebral disc height, most pronounced at L3-L4. 7 mm retrolisthesis 
of L3 on L4. Alignment is otherwise within the range of normal. 
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions. Retroperitoneal and 
paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
Findings by level:
T12-L1: Left paracentral disc extrusion with caudal migration, with no 
significant canal or neural foraminal stenosis. 
L1-L2: Right paracentral partially calcified disc extrusion with extension 
into the right lateral recess and significant intervertebral vacuum 
phenomenon, resulting in moderate canal and mild right neural foraminal 
stenosis.
L2-L3: Small central disc protrusion with vacuum phenomenon, resulting in 
mild canal stenosis. No significant neural foraminal stenosis.
L3-L4: Large broad-based disc bulge with nearly completely obliterated 
intervertebral disc space and vacuum phenomenon, resulting in moderate 
right and mild left neural foraminal stenosis. Irregularity of the 
inferior endplate of L3 and superior endplate of L4 is nonspecific and may 
represent discogenic degenerative changes or sequela of prior infection.
L4-L5: Left paracentral and lateral disc extrusion with vacuum phenomenon, 
and bilateral facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, 
resulting in moderate left and severe right neural foraminal stenosis.
L5-S1: Small disc osteophyte complex, with no significant canal stenosis. 
Transitional vertebral body anatomy with articulation of bilateral L5 
transverse processes with the sacral ala, resulting in severe bilateral 
neural foraminal stenosis.
Scout images demonstrate sclerosis of bilateral superior acetabula, likely 
degenerative.

IMPRESSION:
1. Technically successful CT-guided core biopsy and fine-needle aspiration 
of the left superior endplate of L5, with collection of samples sent for 
Gram stain and culture, fungal stain and culture, AFB culture, and 
pathology. Samples were placed in a specimen container for transport to 
the laboratory. 
2.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine with multilevel 
disc extrusions and vacuum phenomenon, suggesting degenerative 
spondylolysis. Irregularity of the inferior endplate of L3 and superior 
endplate of L4 is nonspecific, and may represent degenerative discogenic 
endplate changes or the sequela of reported prior treated infection. 
Irregularity and sclerosis of the inferior endplate of L4 and superior 
endplate of L5 corresponds to endplate edema noted on recent outside 
hospital MRI with vacuum disc supportive of disc degeneration;.
3. Degenerative changes are most consipicuous at L5-S1 where transitional 
lumbosacral anatomy results in severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.

FINDINGS:
Hardware: Posterior fusion down to L4; thoracic aspect not included in study.  At T12, right pedicle screw lateral aspect is extraosseous, and the left pedicle screw medial aspect is within bony spinal canal.  At L4, the left pedicle screw is backed out by 6 mm, with tip still in vertebral body.
Bones: Mild scoliosis, improved from pre-operative.  Mild left L4-5 neuroforaminal narrowing due to scoliosis.  T12-L3 spinous processes truncated, with bone graft material in their places.  Left L5 pedicle and pars with transverse fracture (distracted posteriorly in craniocaudal aspect by 9 mm), extending to posterior aspect of superior end plate (nondisplaced); no retropulsion.  No definite extension into right L5 pedicle.  Left L5 pars sclerotic, with possible nondisplaced fracture.  Right L5 pars sclerotic with unfused nondisplaced fracture.  No spondylolisthesis.  No canal stenosis.  Left L5 sacralization of transverse process with pseudoarticulation with left sacral ala.
Paraspinous soft tissues: Moderate amount of fluid in posterior paraspinous muscles, right greater than left, associated with mild scattered high density and minimal gas; this is consistent with postoperative hematoma, and the high density likely represents layering bone graft material; evaluation or extent limited by lack of intravenous contrast.

FINDINGS:  
Vertebral body heights are maintained. There is levoscoliosis with a rotatory component, centered at L2. Additionally, there is approximately 9 mm of anterolisthesis of L5 on S1. Bilateral pars defects are present at L5. There is no acute fracture or subluxation, and spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 is unchanged compared to the prior MRI. There is a prior right-sided laminotomy at L5. Further degenerative changes are described by levels below.
L1-L2:  Mild loss of disc height and small disc bulge. Bilateral facet arthrosis. Mild right neural foraminal narrowing. No spinal canal narrowing.
L2-L3:  Loss of disc height and small disc bulge without spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. Bilateral facet arthrosis.
L3-L4:  No significant disc bulge. Right worse than left facet arthrosis.
L4-L5:  Bilateral facet arthrosis. The synovial cyst noted on the right on the prior MRI is partially visualized, resulting in mild proximal narrowing of the right neural foramen and effacement of the right lateral recess. The left neural foramen and spinal canal are patent.
L5-S1:  A combination of anterolisthesis, disc bulge, and facet arthrosis leads to severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing, left worse than right.

FINDINGS: 
Osseous structures: As compared to the radiographs dating back to 06/29/2014, there has been no significant change in the postsurgical changes at the L5-S1 level with unchanged intravertebral cage position. There is adjacent bone graft material as well as a laminectomy defect at the L5 level. The intervertebral body cage radio-opaque markers are seen predominately in the mid and posterior aspects of the L5-S1 disc space in a similar position as compared to previous studies dating back to 06/29/2014. The most posterior and superior marker, seen along the posteroinferior aspect of the L5 vertebral body on the 6/19/2014, appears not significantly changed in position, possibly up to 2 mm posteriorly displaced compared to that study, but comparison is limited by the difference in technique. Mild resorption of the posteroinferior aspect of the L5 vertebral body noted possibly related to postsurgical change. Minimal anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 not significantly changed compared to prior imaging. The apparent anterolisthesis on the most recent radiograph likely is secondary to its obliquity and technique.
Soft tissue structures: Mild disc material/bulge is seen posterior to the L5-S1 disc space without significant central canal stenosis. As on the prior MRI dated 04/17/2014, there is likely flattening of the left L5 exiting nerve root best seen on the sagittal reformation. Mild to moderate narrowing of the left neuroforamen at the L5-S1 level, predominantly along the inferior aspect of the foramen.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Patient is a 39-year-old female with a history
of prior lumbar spine surgery with new left lower extremity pain
radiating to the level of the knee.

COMPARISONS: None.

TECHNIQUE: The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained,
informed consent was obtained. Specifically, the risks, of
bleeding, infection, and post-procedural headache were explained.

The patient was then brought to the fluoroscopy table and laid in
the prone position. The midline skin overlying the lumbar region
was then sterilized using betadine solution. The area was prepped
and draped in the usual sterile surgical fashion. 1% lidocaine was
then utilized the anesthetize the soft tissue tract to the L5
laminectomy defect. A 19 gauge spinal needle was then advanced
under fluoroscopic guidance into the laminectomy defect. The tip
was confirmed to be within the thecal sac with CSF flowed freely
from the needle hub.

Omnipaque-200 was then injected into the thecal sac under direct
fluoroscopic guidance. Approximately 10 cc was injected. The
needle was then removed. The patient has no significant complaint
during the procedure.

The patient was then sent to the CT scanner for axial imaging.
Contiguous 2.5 mm axial images obtained from the level of T12 to
S3.

Reconstructions of sagittal and coronal plane were also obtained.

FINDINGS:

Sagittal reconstructed images demonstrate a laminectomy defect of
the L5 level. L5 and S1 pedicle screws and rods are noted. A
grade I anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 is seen. An interbody cage
spanning the L5-S1 disc space is noted.

CLINICAL DATA: A 73-year-old female with history of breast
carcinoma, now presents with back pain.

TECHNIQUE:

Helical 3 mm unenhanced imaging was performed of the lumbar spine
traversing the T12 vertebral body through the sacrum. No intravenous
contrast was administered. From the source images, sagittal and
coronal reformats were obtained.

FINDINGS:

Multiple densely sclerotic lesions are identified, the largest of
which measures 8 mm and is identified in the right body of the L4
vertebra. Other smaller sclerotic lesions are identified in the
inferior aspect of the left L4 vertebra, superior aspect of the left
and right L1 vertebra, and sacrum.

Alignment of the lumbar spine demonstrates no spondylolisthesis or
evidence of spondylolysis. Anterior osteophytes are identified at
L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5. There is decreased intervertebral disc space
height at L1-2 and L4-5. Posterior disc calcification is identified
at the level of L4-5, which likely represents calcification of a
herniation of disc in childhood. The disc also demonstrates vacuum
phenomenon at this level.

Level by level interrogation of the lumbar spine demonstrates:

T12-L1: Bilateral facet degeneration and degenerative disease at the
costovertebral junction. No central canal stenosis or neural
foraminal narrowing.

L1-2: Decreased intervertebral disc space height with Schmorl's
node identified at the inferior aspect of the L1 vertebral body. A
broad base disc bulge results in mild central canal stenosis.

L2-3: Broad base disc bulge results in mild central canal
stenosis. A Schmorl's node is identified of the superior aspect of
the L3 vertebra.

L3-4: Broad base disc bulge without neural foraminal narrowing or
central canal stenosis.

L4-5: Broad base disc bulge with bilateral facet hypertrophy
results in moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing and moderate
central canal stenosis. There is vacuum phenomenon of the
intervertebral disc. The posterior disc calcification may contact
the exiting L4 and descending L5 nerve roots, however, this is



difficult to further evaluate given the lack of soft tissue
algorithm.

L5-S1: Broad base disc bulge with bilateral facet hypertrophy.
Vacuum phenomenon is identified with gas in the right neural foramen,
likely secondary to the degenerative disc.

Note is made of Baastrup's deformities at L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1.
A 1.5 cm left adrenal lesion measures 54 Hounsfield units on non-
contrast CT evaluation and therefore is not concordant with adenoma
by non-contrast CT criterion. There is also suggestion of thickening
of the right adrenal gland. A 30-35 Hounsfield units 1.9 cm right
mid kidney lesion is identified medially. There is also right renal
atrophy.


IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple bony sclerotic lesions, without prior evaluations
available for comparison. In a patient with history of breast
carcinoma, these findings are suspicious for metastatic deposits.

2. Lack of soft tissue algorithm limits sensitivity of evaluation
for central canal, neural foraminal, and intervertebral disc
pathology. If patient is clinically able to tolerate and meets
criterion, recommend lumbar spine MRI for further evaluation.

3. Right renal and left adrenal lesions identified, as described
above. Again, recommend follow-up evaluation in the absence of prior
imaging which demonstrates benign nature of these findings, or prior
pathologic correlation of these lesions. Thickened right adrenal
gland.

4. Multilevel degenerative disc disease, as described above. The
most concerning level on this CT evaluation is moderate central canal
stenosis and moderate neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally at L4-5.
Posterior disc calcification at this level is likely secondary to
childhood disc herniation and may contact the exiting L4 and

L5-S1: There is severe disc height reduction and end plate changes.
Bilateral facet arthropathy and a broad-based disc bulge contribute
to mild left and moderate right neural foraminal stenosis. No
significant central canal stenosis is present at this level.

LUMBAR DISKOGRAM WITH CT DISKOGRAPHY: 10/11/04

COMPARISON EXAMS AND/OR REPORTS: MR of the lumbar spine performed
on 10/11/04 at 1030 hours and two outside MR examinations performed
on 9/24/01 and 5/8/01.

TECHNIQUE:

The procedure, risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with
the patient and the patient's questions were answered. Informed
consent was obtained. The patient signed a consent form freely and
it was placed in his chart.

The patient was placed prone on the fluoroscopic table and the back
was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

The 3-4 level was localized fluoroscopically and the C-arm was angled
to find an trajectory to the inferior disc space of L34. The skin at
this site was anesthetized with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine with sodium
bicarbonate. A 19 gauge spinal needle was advanced under fluoroscopic
guidance to the inferior aspect of the left neural foramen. Then,
coaxially a 22 gauge Chiba needle was advanced through the spinal
needle into the center of the L3-4 disc under fluoroscopic
observation.

The process above was repeated at the L4-5 and 5-1 levels.

Omnipaque 180 contrast admixed with Ancef antibiotic was injected
into the L3-4 disc under fluoroscopic observation and recordings of
contrast volume, intensity of pain, similarity of pain to the
patient's usual pain, and maximal pressure were recorded. This
process was repeated at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels.

Following injection of each level, before the needles were removed AP
and lateral views of the lumbar spine were obtained.

The needles were removed and the patient was moved to a gurney for
transport to the CT scanner. He was placed supine on the CT scanner
and contiguous axial 2.5 mm collimation images were obtained through
the lumbar spine with sagittal and coronal reformats made from the
raw axial data.

Subsequently the patient was moved to the recovery area in the
Radiology Department and observed for approximately one hour. The
patient was at his neurological baseline in terms of lower extremity
strength and sensation following the diskogram. He reported low back
pain, for which he received vicodin, 2 tablets. The patient was
discharged home in the care of his wife in good condition with
instructions to contact Dr. Dillon or his personal physician
immediately should his back pain increase or should he develop
weakness, radiculopathy or fever.

ANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine and
intravenous conscious sedation (fentanyl, 50 mcg) with continuous
direct physician monitoring of patient vital signs and pulse
oximetry.

FINDINGS:

DISCOGRAPHY WITH FLUOROSCOPIC GUIDANCE:

L3-4: 2 cc of contrast injected, causing no pain. The peak pressure
achieved was 60 psi. A small subligamentous extravasation of the
contrast through an anterior annular tear was observed.

L4-5: 1 cc of contrast was injected, producing pain of intensity of
7 with a similarity of 7 compared to the patient's usual pain at the
peak pressure of 90 psi. Contrast extravasation was noted through the
left posterior lateral radial tear, entering the left neural foramena
nd epidural space.

L5-S1: 1 cc of contrast was initially injected, causing pain of
intensity of 7 with similarity to his usual pain of 4 out of 10 at
the peak pressure of 80 psi. Another cc of contrast was subsequently
injected, causing a pain of intensity of 8 with a similar to his
usual pain of 8 out of 10 at the peak pressure of 90 psi,

Examination of the pre-injection demonstrates important disc
narrowing at the L4-5 level. There is a slight anterolisthesis of L5
compared to S1 but without spondylolysis.

CT DISKOGRAM:

Examination of the lumbar spine by CT demonstrates a slight
anterolisthesis of L5 compared to S1. The alignment of the remaining
lumbar spine is within normal limits.

Examination of individual axial levels demonstrates the following:

L1-2: Normal.

L2-3: Normal.

L3-4: Contrast fills the nucleus pulposus. There is a slight
anterior extravasation of the contrast through anterior radial tear
with subligamentous containment of this extravasation.

L4-5: The contrast fills the nucleus pulposus with significant loss
of height of the disc height with extravasation of the contrast noted
at the left posteriolateral radial tear. Degenerative disc changes
are noted.

L5-S1: Contrast fills the nucleus pulposus, which is degenerative in
nature with internal disc disruption. However not contrast
extravasation is noted beyond the annulus.

There is no significant central spinal canal stenosis and no
narrowing of the neural foramina.

intravenous contrast. Subsequently, reconstructions were performed
in soft tissue window, coronal, and sagittal projections.

FINDINGS:

There is mild rightward curvature of the upper lumbar spine. There
is no evidence of spondylolysis.

Bone marrow demonstrates normal signal. Several small bone islands
are present throughout the sacrum. There is minimal vacuum
phenomenon in the facet joints, consistent with normal variation.
There is sclerotic change and vacuum phenomenon in right greater than
left sacroiliac joints.

Findings by specific levels:

T12-L1: There is no evidence of foraminal narrowing, spinal
stenosis, or disc space narrowing.

L1-2: There is a possible broad-based disc bulge, without associated
significant canal stenosis or foraminal narrowing.

L2-3: There is no evidence of canal stenosis or foraminal narrowing.

L3-4: There is a possible small broad-based disc bulge without
associated foraminal narrowing or canal stenosis. However, these
entities are difficult to discern on the current study, and MRI would
be more helpful.

taking anticoagulant medications.

Monitored anesthesia care was provided by a nurse, with monitoring of
vital signs. Midazolam was used. Please see chart for specific
doses at specific times.

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:

Prone position. Lower back prepped and draped in standard sterile
fashion. Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine. Under fluoroscopic
guidance, the L3-4, L5-S1, and L4-5 levels were sequentially
localized via a coaxial technique with an outer 19-gauge, 10
centimeter needle, with a 22-gauge inner needle which was used for
accessing the intervertebral disc spaces. After fluoroscopic
verification of intra-disc needle tip location at these three levels,
a mixture of non-ionic Omnipaque (diluted with 10-15 cc mixture of
bacteriostatic saline and cefazolin solution) were injected with the
use of a manometer-syringe for measurement of instillation pressures.
After the three levels were evaluated, the needles were removed. The
back was cleaned with hydrogen peroxide. The patient tolerated the
procedure well.

L3-4: Mild broad-based disc bulge with bilateral lateral
osteophytes. Bilateral facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. Mild
spinal stenosis, but no significant neural foraminal narrowing. The
left lateral prominent osteophyte could potentially be affecting the
exiting left L3 nerve root.

L4-5: Interval resolution of previously present large central disc
protrusion. Persistent moderate broad-based disc bulge with

TECHNIQUE:

Unenhanced helical 3 millimeter transaxial images of the lumbar spine
from L1-2 through S1. Sagittal and coronal reformations were also
obtained.

FINDINGS:

Compared to the previous MRI dated 08/07/00, again noted is marked
asymmetric prominence and expansion of the left psoas muscle which is
seen extending at least from the L1-2 level inferiorly to the L5-S1
level. There is subtle sclerosis with mild cortical irregularities
involving the L3 vertebral body, corresponding to the MR evidence of
diffuse metastatic infiltration of this vertebral body.

There is also a fracture through the left L3 transverse process which
likely represents a pathologic fracture. There is also continued
evidence of increased paravertebral soft tissue which extends to and
obliterates within the bilateral L3-4 neural foramina. Findings are
all consistent with and most concerning for metastatic disease.

Mild diffuse osteopenia is present within the sacrum.

No other fractures or bony, lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified. There is a defect in the left L5 pars interarticularis
with associated sclerosis of the contralateral pars, compatible with
L5 spondylolysis. There is no significant associated
spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.

There is very slight decrease in height of the L3 and L5 vertebral
bodies but the lumbar vertebral bodies do remain normally aligned.

Specific transaxial imaging at the following levels:

L1-2: Incompletely evaluated, but no significant central stenosis or
neural foraminal narrowing.

L2-3: Increased left paravertebral soft tissue which extends into
and involves the left neural foramen and is seen in association with
the enlarged left psoas muscle. No significant central stenosis nor
right-sided neural foraminal narrowing.

L3-4: As described above, mild diffuse sclerosis, consistent with
metastatic infiltration with a left transverse process fracture which
is likely pathologic in etiology. Correlation with any recent
history of trauma might also be helpful. Increased paravertebral
soft tissue, left much greater than right with extension into both
neural foramina. No significant central stenosis.
L4-5: Very mild broad based disc bulge. No significant central
stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.

sclerosis. No significant associated spondylolisthesis, central
stenosis nor neural foraminal narrowing.

foramina. The coccyx appears intact.

Computer reformatted images in sagittal and coronal planes
demonstrate the grade 2 spondylolisthesis at L5 with respect to S1.
The severe angulation as described on prior radiograph is also noted.
Anterior angulation of the upper sacral segment with respect to the
residual lower sacral segment is also noted, which is likely post-
traumatic, and there is an acute kyphotic deformity within the
sacrum. There is mild overriding of the healed fracture.

The sacroiliac joints are grossly unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Grade 2 L5-S1 spondylolisthesis with L5 laminectomy and adjacent
hypertrophic changes which may be degenerative of postoperative in

CLINICAL DATA: Status post multiple osteotomies.

TECHNIQUE:

3 mm transaxial images through the lumbar spine were obtained with
coronal and sagittal reformations.

COMPARISON: No prior films are available for comparison.

FINDINGS:

There is evidence of six non rib-bearing lumbar vertebra.
Interpedicular screws are identified bilaterally through L4 through
L6. A solitary interpedicular screw is seen through the left L3
pedicle and the right L2 pedicle. There is no evidence of posterior
fixation hardware connecting the interpedicular screws. Post lumbar
laminotomy changes are identified at L6 with lumbar laminectomy
changes seen from L1 through L5. Posterior bone grafting material
extends from L1 to L6 (the lowest non rib-bearing lumbar vertebra).
Anterior fusions are identified at L1-2, L2-3.

The study was performed utilizing a bone algorithm, and soft tissue
evaluation is limited. However, there is evidence of gas locules
within the posterior soft tissues at the level of L2 and L3 most
likely secondary to recent surgery.

L1-2: There is evidence of posterior and anterior fusion. The
neural foramina are patent bilaterally. There is no evidence of
central stenosis or intracanalicular bony fragmentation.

L2-3: There is evidence of anterior fusion and posterior
laminectomy. Pedicle screw is identified traversing the right L2
pedicle and the left L3 pedicle. Posterior laminectomy with bone
grafting material is seen surrounding the left L3 posterior elements.

L3-4: There is loss of intervertebral disc height. Bilateral
facet hypertrophy is identified. There is no significant neural
foraminal narrowing.

L4-5: Bilateral interpedicular screws are seen through the L4
pedicles. There is significant right-sided osteophyte with associated
narrowing of the intervertebral disc. This is related to the leftward
lateral scoliosis.

L5-6: Bilateral interpedicular screws are identified at this
level. There is a suggestion of a pars defect (spondylolysis) at the
right L6 pars interarticularis. The intervertebral disc at this level
demonstrates degenerative loss of disc height.

L6-S1: The intervertebral disc is unremarkable. The neural
foramina are patent bilaterally. Included sacroiliac joints
demonstrate anterior sclerosis compatible with sacroiliitis, left
greater than right.

IMPRESSION:

1. Left lateral lumbar scoliosis. Six non rib-bearing lumbar
vertebrae.

2. Multiple interpedicular screws, as described above, with

CLINICAL DATA: Left sacroiliac strain. Low back pain.

TECHNIQUE:

3 mm contiguous transaxial images were obtained from the level of L1-2
through the mid sacrum. Additionally, coronal and sagittal
reconstructions were obtained.

FINDINGS:

Sagittal reconstructions show normal alignment of the lumbar spine
without spondylolisthesis or spondylolysis. Moderate to severe disc
space narrowing is seen at L4-5 and L5-S1.

At L4-5, there is a left paracentral disc protrusion/extrusion which
significantly narrows the left lateral recess and likely displaces the
traversing left L5 nerve root posteriorly. This creates mild central
canal stenosis as well. No neural foraminal narrowing is seen. A small,
calcified portion of this disc protrusion/extrusion is seen along the
right lateral aspect.

At L3-4, there is a mild, broad-based disc bulge which also has a
linear calcification associated with the posterior aspect of it which
may represent either calcified disc or focal calcification of the
posterior longitudinal ligament. No significant neural foraminal or
central canal compromise is seen at this level. A broad-based disc
bulge with a left paracentral component is also seen at L5-S1, which
also causes no significant neural foraminal or central canal
compromise.

IMPRESSION:

1. Large left paracentral protrusion/extrusion at the L4-5 level
which significantly narrows the left lateral recess and likely causes
posterior displacement of the traversing left L5 nerve root. A small
associated calcification is seen along the right lateral aspect of this

sagittal reconstructions were obtained.

FINDINGS:

Coronal and sagittal reconstructions show normal alignment of the
lumbar spine. Disk space narrowing seen from L3-4 through L5-S1. End-
plate sclerosis and osteophytosis is seen at L4-5, most marked at the
inferior end-plate of L4, consistent with degenerative disease.

The patient has a congenitally small central canal secondary to short
pedicles.

The following findings are seen at the given levels:

L2-3: No significant neural foraminal nor central canal stenosis.

L3-4: Bilateral ligamentum flavum hypertrophy causing mild central
stenosis without neural foraminal narrowing.

L4-5: Broad-based disk bulge with a left paracentral component and
bilateral ligamentum flavum hypertrophy creating moderate central
stenosis and mild left neural foraminal narrowing.

L5-S1: Broad-based disk bulge and bilateral ligamentum flavum
hypertrophy create mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing without
significant central canal stenosis.

No spondylolysis is seen.

329,"CT SCAN OF THE LUMBOSACRAL SPINE WITH REFORMATIONS: 2/28/98.

CLINICAL DATA: Status post fusion with low back pain.

TECHNIQUE:

3 mm contiguous axial images were obtained from the mid body of L2
through the sacrum. Additionally, sagittal and coronal
reconstructions were obtained.

FINDINGS:

There is evidence of prior surgery with bilateral interpedicular
screws in place, extending from L4 through S1. These screws appear
intact and traverse the pedicles without encroachment upon the
spinal canal.

A grade 2 spondylolisthesis is seen at L5-S1. There are secondary
endplate changes along the posterior aspect of L5 and the mid- to
posterior aspect of the upper endplate of S1. Given the degree of
spondylolisthesis, there is likely underlying spondylolysis.
However, overlying metallic artifact obscures visualization of this
region.

It should be noted that this examination is somewhat limited due to
metallic artifact from the L4 through the S1 levels. If there is
clinical concern for intraspinal pathology, a plain film myelogram
may be obtained.

Slight loss of height of the posterior aspect of L5 is identified,
as well.

Posterior to L3 through L4, there is amorphous high attenuation in
the bilateral posterior paraspinal region which may be related to
old fusion material versus hemorrhage.

At L3-4, there is bilateral ligamentum flavum hypertrophy without
secondary significant central canal stenosis. The spinal canal
appears widely patent at L4-5 and L5-S1. However, as previously
mentioned, significant streak artifact obscures complete
visualization.

IMPRESSION:

1. Interpedicular screws in place from L4 through S1 with screws
appearing intact and in good position traversing the pedicles
without encroachment upon the spinal canal.

2. Grade 2 spondylolisthesis of L1 on S1 with secondary endplate
change seen at this level. There is mild loss of the vertebral body
heights posteriorly of L5.
3. Significant metallic artifact obscures the spinal canal from
L4 through S1, and therefore this area cannot be completely
evaluated. If there is clinical concern for pathology involving the
spinal canal, a plain film myelogram may be obtained.

INDICATION: Suspected L3-5 stenosis.

TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired 3 mm imaging was performed from the
inferior aspect of T12 through the upper sacrum. Images reviewed
on bone and soft tissue windows and computer reformations were
obtained in coronal and sagittal planes.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS:

Sagittal reformations demonstrate a grade I spondylolisthesis with
less than 25% anterior placement of L4 with respect to L5. There
is intervertebral disc space narrowing at L4-5 and a vacuum disc
phenomenon. Degenerative end-plate changes are present superiorly
at L5. Sclerotic changes are seen at the L4 pars interarticularis
bilaterally likely related to chronic stress in this region. No
clear displacement is identified to indicate a complete
spondylolysis. Best appreciated on the sagittal reformations is a
moderate degree of distal abdominal aortic calcifications and
proximal iliac artery calcification.

Axial interrogation:

T12-L1: No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.

L1-2: A right anterior osteophyte is present. Although a mild
broad based bulge and mild facet joint hypertrophy is present there
is no significant neural foraminal narrowing or spinal stenosis.

L2-3: There is a mild broad-based disc bulge which combines with
hypertrophic ligaments to result in mild central stenosis. There
is no significant neural foraminal narrowing.

L3-4: There is a mild broad-based disc bulge which causes mild
canal stenosis and extends into the lateral recesses to cause mild
inferior neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally.

L4-5: Again noted are the vacuum disc and degenerative end-plate
changes. The L4-5 disc is mildly uncoved and the facet joints are
hypertrophied. These findings result in mild to moderate spinal
stenosis and severe right and moderate left neural foraminal
narrowing.

L5-S1: A small broad-based disc bulge and facet hypertrophic
changes result in mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.

IMPRESSION:

1. Grade I spondylolisthesis with sclerotic changes in the pars
interarticularis bilaterally at L4-5 and vacuum disc phenomenon
with severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing and
