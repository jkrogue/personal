 FINDINGS:
 
 At the anterior dorsal surface of the talar dome, there is a poorly
 corticated fragment directed superiorly which may represent an
 enthesophyte or a small avulsion fracture. There is the suggestion
 of associated soft tissue swelling and a small ankle effusion,
 making it more likely that this represents a small avulsion

 Alignment at the ankle appears well maintained. Ankle mortise is
 normal, with no evidence of disruption of the tibial plafond or the
 talar dome.
 
 2. Diffuse soft tissue swelling is observed at the left ankle,
 correlation with clinical exam is, therefore, recommended to
 exclude ligamentous laxity. If there is concern for extensive
 soft tissue injury, this could be better assessed with MR.
 
 3. Incidentally observed is a benign-appearing, well-circumscribed
 accessory ossicle posterior to the talar dome compatible with an os
 trigonum. Calcaneus and limited evaluation of the hindfoot is

 Bone mineralization is within normal limits. Linear radiolucency
 through the fifth metatarsal base may represent a fracture. An
 anterior plantar spur off the anteroinferior aspect of the
 calcaneus is noted. In the proper clinical setting, this can be
 associated with plantar fasciitis or ankylosing spondylitis. A
 well-corticated bony fragment is seen just superior to the proximal
 tarsal navicular just anterior to the talus on the lateral views.

 through its base at its site of apparent attachment to the

 significant soft tissue swelling is observed.

 additional fracture line extends.

 1. There is a comminuted fracture involving the distal fibula.
 The distal fibular fragment remains attached to the talus and both
 are displaced posteriorly and laterally. These findings are
 consistent with a complete disruption of the tibiofibular ligament
 complex with lateral instability. Additionally, on the oblique

 injury involving the tibiofibular ligament. There is gross soft
 tissue swelling throughout the ankle.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. AP, oblique, and lateral views of the left ankle are submitted.
 There is soft tissue swelling at this significantly deformed left
 ankle. Some soft tissue mottling is also identified. This may
 represent edema, although a component of cellulitis cannot be
 excluded on the basis of these films.
 
 2. There is significant bony deformity of the distal tibia and
 fibula, as well as of the midfoot, talus, and calcaneus. Overall,
 this is most consistent with the appearance of previous significant
 trauma.
 
 3. There appears to be fusion of the distal tibia and fibula, as
 well as absence of significant destruction of the talus. The
 calcaneus is also ill-defined and abnormal in shape. In addition,
 the midfoot bones appear flattened, giving the appearance on lateral
 film of a pes planus deformity. Multiple osteophytes are consistent
 with degenerative changes in this region.
 
 4. Given the extent of abnormal morphology of the bones in this
 region, it is difficult to exclude an acute fracture, although no
 acute fracture line is presently identified. CT scan may be
 indicated for further evaluation. In addition, comparison with
 previous films, which likely exist at another institution, may be
 quite useful.

 FINDINGS:
 
 A spiral proximolaterally displaced distal fibular diaphyseal
 fracture is observed. The fibulotalar joint space is increased,

 the talus. A small fracture fragment from the articulating surface
 of the tibial plafond is noted medial to the distal talus. No other

 into the interosseous ligament and continuation into the articulating
 surface of the tibial plafond with possible comminuted fracture of
 the articulating surface of the distal tibia is seen.
 
 2. The mortise is distorted, with both the tibia and fibula being
 displaced from their articulations with the talus. This implies
 stretching or tear of the deltoid ligament.

 On AP, lateral, and mortise views of the right ankle, there is mild
 soft tissue swelling at the lateral malleolus. On single view, there
 is a calcific focus just distal to the right fibula that may
 represent a degenerative free body or an avulsed fragment. This is
 not well seen on other projections. No clear evidence of transverse
 fracture of the fibula nor fracture of the tibia or talus.
 Tibiotalar joint space is well maintained. There is evidence of
 anterior osteophyte at the tibiotalar joint extending from the
 anterior margin of the tibia. Also noted is calcaneal plantar spur.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 AP, lateral, and oblique views of both the right foot and right ankle
 demonstrates small, nonspecific sclerotic foci in the proximal and
 distal phalanx of the first digit, likely bone islands. On the
 lateral view of the foot, calcific density is seen just superior to
 the talonavicular joint. This may represent an avulsion fracture of
 the navicular bone, and clinical correlation to site of pain is
 recommended.
 
 The joint spaces are maintained. The ankle mortise is intact.

 adjacent to the fibula. This is felt to represent attachment for
 interosseous membrane. No evidence of fracture of the distal tibia
 or fibula. Mortise appears intact. Some osteophytosis was noted of
 the medial malleous. Heel spur is also noted on lateral view of the
 ankle. No evidence of talar or calcaneal fracture. No radiopaque
 foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of acute traumatic injury to the ankle.
 
 2. Degenerative changes at the medial malleolus and calcaneus
 consistent with chronic changes.
 
 3. Irregular cortex at the distal tibia is consistent with
 attachment of interosseous membrane.

 FINDINGS:
 
 An osseous fragment is noted distal to the medial malleolus
 consistent with an avulsion fracture of indeterminate age. There is
 extensive associated soft tissue swelling. There is widening of the
 ankle mortise. These findings suggest a ""Maissoneuve"" fracture and
 a tibia and fibula radiograph is recommended for further evaluation
 of possible proximal fibular fracture.

 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a slightly prominent posterior talar process. There is no
 evidence of acute bony fracture involving the left ankle. There are
 mild, subchondral, cystic changes involving the posterior facet of
 the tibial plafond which likely represents degenerative subchondral
 cystic changes. MR or CT could be obtained to further evaluate this
 area if clinically indicated. It does not appear to be an
 osteochondral lesion.
 
 There is a small amount of soft tissue swelling along the medial
 malleolus. A small amount of osteophytic spurring is seen at the os
 calcis which likely reflects an element of chronic Achilles
 tendinosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of fracture left ankle.

 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal, lateral, and oblique views of the right ankle demonstrates
 a spiral fracture of the distal fibular metaphysis with minimal
 displacement of the distal fracture fragment. Horizontal fracture of
 the right medial malleolus of the distal tibia at the level of the
 ankle mortise with minimal lateral deviation of the ankle mortise and
 the foot relative to the distal tibia. Lateral view of the ankle
 suggests a nondisplaced fracture of the posterior malleolus of the
 distal right tibia.
 
 Frontal, lateral, and oblique views of the right foot demonstrate a
 nondisplaced fracture of the distal metaphysis of the first
 metatarsal in near anatomic alignment. Bones are diffusely
 osteopenic. Irregular bony fragment just lateral to the cuboid
 appears well corticated and most likely represents an old fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Trimalleolar fracture including distal fibular diaphysis, medial
 malleolus, and posterior malleolus. There is also a fracture of the
 distal first metatarsal in near anatomic alignment. The lateral
 aspect of the ankle mortise appears widened on a single frontal view,
 and this is suspicious for ligamentous injury as well. The emergency
 room attending was norified of these findings at the time of

 inferior to the tip of the medial malleolus. The adjacent margin of
 the medial malleolus does appear somewhat irregular, such that this
 may represent a chronic avulsion fragment. If the patient is tender
 in this region, perhaps this represents an acute injury. However,
 significant soft tissue swelling is noted on the lateral aspect of
 the ankle, where no fracture is appreciated.
 
 The foot demonstrates a moderate degree of metatarsus adductus,
 although these do not appear to be erect radiographs. Additionally,
 the hind foot relationship on the frontal radiograph demonstrates a
 talocalcaneal angle of approximately 17.0 degrees, which would be
 consistent with a hind foot varus if these were weight-bearing views.
 A significant ankle effusion is noted on lateral radiographs,
 suggesting underlying inflammation or prior trauma. If clinically
 indicated, MR of the ankle would be helpful to assess soft tissue
 structures.

 the base of the fifth metatarsal.
 
 A mild degree of ankle soft tissue swelling is present which may be
 secondary to venous stasis or if recent injury has occurred, trauma.
 No ankle joint effusion is noted. A posterior calcaneal spur is
 appreciated. There is a well corticated oval bony density
 overlapping the anterior margin of the distal tibia which may
 represent a chronic avulsion fracture or an interarticular loose body
 within the ankle joint.

 Three views of the left ankle were submitted for interpretation.
 There is a comminuted fracture extending through the distal left
 fibula with minimal anterior angulation. There is associated soft
 tissue swelling. There is a well-corticated 2 mm density just
 inferior to the medial malleolus which may represent an avulsion
 injury or prior trauma. In addition, there is a well-corticated bone
 fragment between the talus and the navicular which most likely also
 represents old trauma.

 avulsive fracture off the articular aspect of the anterior tibia versus
 a chronic loose body from prior trauma given the fact that no joint
 effusion is identified. The medial and lateral malleoli are
 unremarkable.

 On the frontal view of the knee, there is a step-off of the medial
 tibial plateau and a vague linear lucency extending from the plateau
 more laterally. Lateral film demonstrates a possible small

 this may be an artifact due to a combination of osteopenia and
 overlapping tibia and fibula, the adjacent soft tissue swelling
 makes this concerning for cortical and bony erosion due to
 osteomyelitis. Correlation with clinical findings is recommended.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimally displaced transverse fractures of the right second,
 third, and fourth metatarsal heads are noted. These are associated
 with sclerosis suggesting that they are subacute or chronic. There
 is also the suggestion of a possible nondisplaced transverse
 fracture of the first metatarsal head with associated minimal
 sclerosis also suggesting that it is chronic. Associated soft
 tissue swelling subjacent to the metatarsal head is observed.
 Although chronic osteomyelitis is not completely excluded, it is
 considered less likely than simply unhealed old stress fracture. If
 conservative management fails, a white blood cell scan or MRI could
 better evaluate. Vascular calcifications are incidentally noted,
 consistent with diabetes mellitus.

 also the subtle suggestion of possible extension anteriorly to
 involve the calcaneocuboid joint.
 
 A second fracture is noted within the distal fibula, where the
 lateral margin of the fibula demonstrates a cortical step-off with
 extensive surrounding soft tissue swelling. A more moderate degree
 of soft tissue swelling is noted medially.

 FINDINGS: Three views of the left ankle are submitted. No evidence of
 fracture, dislocation or effusion is noted at the ankle. No cortical
 disruption is identified. There is, however, a focal, well
 marginated, roughly ovoid lesion expanding the distal fibula, with
 suggestion of cystic internal components. No evidence of periosteal
 reaction. Narrow zone of transition from abnormal to normal bone is
 noted. In a patient of 17 years of age, this is most consistent with
 nonossifying fibroma, a benign entity.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 Thickening of the cortex and trabecular coarsening is noted
 throughout the left hemipelvis consistent with Paget's disease.
 Extensive degenerative disease is noted of the left hip joint which
 is likely a complication of Paget's disease. While no fracture
 lucency is visualized in the left hip, fracture cannot be excluded
 in the presence of such pathologic bone, and hip MRI is recommended
 to exclude fracture if there is clinical concern. In addition, a
 MRI could differentiate malignant degeneration from changes of
 Paget's.

 FINDINGS:
 
 A corticated ossified fragment is identified superior to the
