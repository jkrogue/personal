FINDINGS:

There is a minimally displaced fracture of the medial aspect of
the distal tibia. In addition, there is widening of the mortise,
which is indicative of ligamentous injury of the ankle. On one
view, a tiny fragment is seen located between the medial malleolus
and the talus, which may indicate an avulsion injury of the

FINDINGS:

There is an oblique fracture involving the right fibula extending
from the tibiotalar joint proximally for approximately 8

stripping of a 3 centimeter segment of cortex through which an
additional fracture line extends.

The medial clear space between the anterior aspect of the medial
portion of the talus and the anterior aspect of the medial
malleolus is slightly increased measuring approximately 5.5
millimeters. This would suggest deltoid ligament damage.
Extensive soft tissue swelling is seen about both malleoli.

IMPRESSION:

Deformity of the lateral malleolus of the right foot is noted,
suggesting fracture of the metaphysis, possibly subacute. Slight
deformity also affects the distal tibia as well. These findings are
probably not acute, raising the question of repeated trauma to the

3. There appears to be fusion of the distal tibia and fibula, as
well as absence of significant destruction of the talus. The
calcaneus is also ill-defined and abnormal in shape. In addition,
the midfoot bones appear flattened, giving the appearance on lateral
film of a pes planus deformity. Multiple osteophytes are consistent
with degenerative changes in this region.

4. Given the extent of abnormal morphology of the bones in this
region, it is difficult to exclude an acute fracture, although no
acute fracture line is presently identified. CT scan may be
indicated for further evaluation. In addition, comparison with
previous films, which likely exist at another institution, may be
quite useful.

fracture with posterior displacement of the fracture fragment.

2. The ankle mortise appears to be still within normal limits.

3. On the frontal view, the fracture lucency appears to extend
beyond the growth plate, the raising the possibility of fracture
involvement of the epiphysis; therefore, suggesting that this may be
a type IV Salter-Harris fracture.

CLINICAL DATA: 41-year-old woman status post fall on left ankle.

FINDINGS:

A spiral proximolaterally displaced distal fibular diaphyseal
fracture is observed. The fibulotalar joint space is increased,
consistent with dislocation. The distal tibia is also displaced off
the talus. A small fracture fragment from the articulating surface
of the tibial plafond is noted medial to the distal talus. No other
acute fractures are identified. A probable old fracture fragment is
seen dorsal and distal to the talus. Mild soft tissue swelling is
observed adjacent to the acute fibular fracture.

IMPRESSION:

1. Displaced fracture of the distal fibular diaphysis with extension
into the interosseous ligament and continuation into the articulating
surface of the tibial plafond with possible comminuted fracture of
the articulating surface of the distal tibia is seen.

2. The mortise is distorted, with both the tibia and fibula being
displaced from their articulations with the talus. This implies
stretching or tear of the deltoid ligament.

3. If clinically indicated, a CT scan could better evaluate for
possible interarticular osseous fragments.

CLINICAL DATA: 17-year-old, status post injury to right ankle.

IMPRESSION:

1. A small 1-2 millimeter rounded radiodensity is seen projecting in
the soft tissues of the lateral malleolus. This may represent a small
avulsion fracture or focal calcification of a ligamentous structure.
Clinical correlation is recommended. There is a mild soft tissue
swelling in this region.

2. An osteochondral defect is present on the lateral talar dome
consistent with traumatic injury.

3. There is possible widening of the ankle mortis suggesting
syndesmosis disruption. The fibulla is not included on the current
study, however, if pain of the proximal fibula is present, a Masonneuve
fracture is a possibility. May consider proximal fibular radiographs.

4. MRI of the ankle may be indicated to further evaluate the above
described abnormalities.

Diffuse soft tissue swelling with evidence of subcutaneous edema is
identified surrounding the foot and ankle.

Two calcific densities are identified adjacent to the anterior distal

this may represent a subtle fracture. This finding was not
identified on the comparison films dated 9/18/00.

A well-corticated density is identified just inferior to the medial

HISTORY: Right leg pain. Status post trauma. Evaluate.

FINDINGS:

Frontal, lateral, and oblique views of the right ankle demonstrates
a spiral fracture of the distal fibular metaphysis with minimal
displacement of the distal fracture fragment. Horizontal fracture of
the right medial malleolus of the distal tibia at the level of the
ankle mortise with minimal lateral deviation of the ankle mortise and
the foot relative to the distal tibia. Lateral view of the ankle
suggests a nondisplaced fracture of the posterior malleolus of the
distal right tibia.

Frontal, lateral, and oblique views of the right foot demonstrate a
nondisplaced fracture of the distal metaphysis of the first
metatarsal in near anatomic alignment. Bones are diffusely
osteopenic. Irregular bony fragment just lateral to the cuboid
appears well corticated and most likely represents an old fracture.

IMPRESSION:

Trimalleolar fracture including distal fibular diaphysis, medial
malleolus, and posterior malleolus. There is also a fracture of the
distal first metatarsal in near anatomic alignment. The lateral
aspect of the ankle mortise appears widened on a single frontal view,

IMPRESSION:

There is an oval, fairly well corticated bony fragment lying just
inferior to the tip of the medial malleolus. The adjacent margin of
the medial malleolus does appear somewhat irregular, such that this
may represent a chronic avulsion fragment. If the patient is tender
in this region, perhaps this represents an acute injury. However,
significant soft tissue swelling is noted on the lateral aspect of
the ankle, where no fracture is appreciated.

The foot demonstrates a moderate degree of metatarsus adductus,
although these do not appear to be erect radiographs. Additionally,
the hind foot relationship on the frontal radiograph demonstrates a
talocalcaneal angle of approximately 17.0 degrees, which would be
consistent with a hind foot varus if these were weight-bearing views.
A significant ankle effusion is noted on lateral radiographs,
suggesting underlying inflammation or prior trauma. If clinically
indicated, MR of the ankle would be helpful to assess soft tissue
structures.

Addendum # 1

Please note that the initial report described findings only on the
left ankle. Radiographs of the bilateral ankles are submitted. As
discussed on the initial study, there is a poorly corticated bony
fragment just inferior to the distal tip of the left fibula which may
represent an avulsion fracture. A significant degree of soft tissue
swelling is present surrounding the left ankle, but also to a similar
degree within the entire foot and within the more proximal calf such
that the swelling may be related to venous status or lymph edema.

On the right, there is a more well corticated subcentimeter bony
fragment inferior to the distal tip of the fibula which does not
appear to be acute in nature and likely represents a chronic avulsion
fragment. No significant degree of right foot or ankle swelling is
appreciated in comparison to the left.

COMPARISON: No previous studies.

FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:

There is no definite radiographic evidence of an acute fracture.
There is a fairly well corticated oval ossification adjacent to the
lateral margin of the cuboid, likely representing an os peroneum.
There is no irregularity of the underlying cuboid to suggest this
represents an acute fracture.

Also noted on the frontal radiograph of the ankle is a subtle
subcentimeter ossification, just inferior to the distal tip of
the fibula. If there is clinical focal pain in this site, a small
avulsion should be entertained. Otherwise, this fragment likely
represents an accessory ossicle.

IMPRESSION:

Large amount of soft tissue swelling is present surrounding the
ankle, particularly medially.

An oblique fracture extends through the distal fibula, several
centimeters above the level of the ankle mortise. The fracture plane
is fairly nondisplaced. An ankle effusion is noted on the lateral
radiograph, as are degenerative osteophytic spurs at the distal
margin of the navicular and along the inferior and posterior aspects
of the calcaneus.

A well-corticated round subcentimeter ossification lies just inferior
to the tip of the medial malleolus which likely represents an
accessory ossification center. A small avulsion fracture in this
location may also be possible.

obliquely oriented lucency in the intertrochanteric region, which
does not appear to effect the adjacent cortices. While this lucency
likely represents a vascular groove or some other normal variant, a
nondisplaced intertrochanteric left femoral fracture cannot be
completely excluded and, if clinically indicated, MR examination of

dislocation.

Left ankle series: The left ankle mortise is intact. There is a small
calcific density at the anterior aspect of the tibiotalar joint with
a small lytic region involving the anterior mid tibia at its articular
surface with the talus. This combination may represent a small
avulsive fracture off the articular aspect of the anterior tibia versus
a chronic loose body from prior trauma given the fact that no joint
effusion is identified. The medial and lateral malleoli are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

Soft tissue swelling is noted about the lateral malleolus. Several
lucent areas are defined within the distal left fibula. The
possibility of a nondisplaced fracture is raised. An ossific
density is present adjacent to the medial malleolus as well as a
small ossific density interposed between the distal medial aspect
of the fibula and the lateral aspect of the left talus. These
ossific densities are probably accessory ossicles that are not felt
to represent an acute fracture.

Clinical correlation recommended as it relates to the findings
affecting the distal left fibula. Follow-up film might be helpful.

The above findings related to the left fibula were called to the ER
Dr. Polevoi at 8:40 a.m. on 11/28/94.
